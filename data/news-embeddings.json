Mario Monti, ex premier e senatore a vita, intervistato da Radio 24, commenta così le parole di Emmanuel Macron sul possibile invio di truppe di terra, di militari, a combattere in Ucraina. E tra le righe, l'ex premier condivide la linea dell'Eliseo.\n\nPoi lo stesso Monti ha aggiunto: \"Se viene richiesto un mix di strumenti militari e uomini, mandare soldati a combattere per difendere l'Europa sarà più difficile perché le nostre cittadinanze si sono abituate alla pace e non ammettono di morire per difendere la patria e la pace. Forse più che mandare uomini europei a combattere là in Ucraina bisognerebbe intensificare il sostegno all'Ucraina con armamenti e anche dal punto di vista finanziario\".\n\nE sulle parole dell'ex premier è intervenuto il ministro dei Trasporti, Matteo Salvini: \"Mi turba che dopo Macron anche Monti oggi parli dell’invio di soldati italiani a combattere in Ucraina. Questi vanno curati: chi la pensa così e lo dice come se fosse una cosa normale, è pericoloso. Se Monti e Macron hanno tanta voglia di combattere, vadano in Ucraina.Parlare di soldati italiani che potranno andare a combattere e morire in Ucraina la ritengo una cosa gravissima - ha sottolineato Salvini -. Ieri Putin ha invitato al dialogo e io spero che il 2024 sia l’anno della pace. Io sono disponibile a ricostruire porti, ferrovie, strade, scuole e ospedali Quando qualche italiano parla facilmente di guerra e soldati che combattono e muoiono fuori dai confini, secondo me c’è

parole pronunciate questa mattina dal ministro del Tesoro, Giancarlo Giorgetti: \"Grazie agli antichi romani che hanno insegnato al mondo il diritto ci sono i diritti acquisiti, la Costituzione, c’è un principio che uno che ha cominciato il lavoro nel 2021 ha diritto di finirlo nel 2023 e presentare le fatture, cosa abbastanza banale che dovrebbe essere di facile intelligibilità per chiunque. Quando noi siamo intervenuti a porre una diga a questa cosa la valanga era già partita. Avete presente il Vajont? Quando c’è stata la valanga che veniva giù era già partita, poi arrivata giù ha prodotto disastri\".\n\nMa a quanto pare per Repubblica le responsabilità maggiori sul grave danno arrecato alle casse dello Stato da questo provvedimento voluto dai grillini, udite, udite, sarebbero dell'esecutivo Meloni. Una balla colossale. E così il sottosegretario alla presidenza del Consiglio, Giovanbattista Fazzolari all'Ansa bolla così i calcoli del quotidiano di Molinari: \"Oggi leggo la surreale ricostruzione secondo la quale il disastro Superbonus sarebbe responsabilità di Giorgia Meloni. Una barzelletta che non fa ridere. Dovrebbe oramai essere palese a tutti che se il governo Meloni non fosse intervenuto tra i primissimi provvedimenti per fermare la falla del Superbonus oggi i conti sarebbero in enorme sofferenza. È bizzarro che invece di riconoscere questo dato oggi ci sia chi a sinistra prova invece a nascondere i meriti del governo che ha salvato i conti e prova anzi a dare una responsabilità su questo disastro al governo\". Infine ha aggiunto: \"Come per qualunque legge, gli effetti si vedono successivamente: dire che la colpa è di chi sta subendo gli effetti di una legge fatta prima\", con il governo Conte II \"è

dal 6 gennaio.\n\nIscriviti\n\nIl governo degli Stati Uniti ha revocato alcune licenze che permettevano ad aziende statunitensi del settore dei microchip di vendere prodotti e componenti alla cinese Huawei. Lo ha annunciato martedì il dipartimento del Commercio, non specificando per quali prodotti sia stato deciso il divieto di esportazione. Varie restrizioni alle esportazioni di tecnologia e in particolare di chip verso la Cina sono state introdotte a partire dal 2019, nel timore che potessero essere usate nel settore militare cinese: i rapporti fra aziende private e stato cinese sono molto stretti.\n\nHuawei era stata molto colpita dai primi divieti e poi da quelli definiti dall’amministrazione del presidente Joe Biden nell’ottobre del 2022, ma in tempi recenti ha mostrato la capacità di aggirarli e segni di ripresa: in particolare ha presentato un computer che sfrutta sistemi di intelligenza artificiale basandosi su un chip dell’azienda statunitense Intel (MateBook X Pro) e uno smartphone che utilizza un microchip che non dovrebbe avuto avere. Secondo alcuni esperti citati dal Financial Times le revoche delle licenze riguardano le aziende Intel e Qualcomm e potrebbero condizionare la capacità di Huawei di rifornirsi di chip per computer e smartphone.\n\nC’è molto altro\n\nIl Post spiega le cose bene, usa un linguaggio chiaro e vuole farsi capire da tutte e tutti.

Garrick, uno dei più antichi e celebri club privati di Londra, che finora consentiva l’adesione solo agli uomini, ha votato per permettere l’ammissione anche delle donne, col 60 per cento dei voti favorevoli e il 40 per cento contrari. Il voto è stato organizzato dopo anni di dibattiti e discussioni interne: alcuni membri chiedevano da tempo di aprire il club anche alle donne, e a tal proposito erano state proposte donne note come l’attrice Judi Dench e la studiosa Mary Beard. Alcuni dei membri più anziani sostenevano però che permettere l’adesione alle donne avrebbe stravolto l’identità del Garrick, fondato nel 1831 e diventato uno dei club privati più antichi della città.\n\nTag:\nGARRICK\n-\nLONDRA\n-\nREGNO UNITO\nCONSIGLIATI\nÈ giusto salvare una vita impedendo di salvarne milioni?\nLe città più grandi al mondo di cui non si sente mai parlare\nIl problema di

all'ospedale di al Shifa, il 27 ottobre 2023 (AP Photo/ Abed Khaled, File)\n\nL’ufficio per la comunicazione del governo della Striscia di Gaza ha detto che è stata trovata una terza fossa comune all’ospedale di al Shifa, il più grande operativo nella Striscia prima che fosse messo sotto assedio a novembre e poi di nuovo a fine marzo. Secondo le autorità locali, controllate da Hamas, i corpi delle persone palestinesi recuperati finora sono 49.\n\nQuella scoperta in questi giorni è la terza fossa comune trovata nell’area dell’ospedale e la settima che le autorità locali segnalano di aver trovato vicino agli ospedali della Striscia. Ad aprile per esempio era stata scoperta una fossa comune con almeno 180 cadaveri a Khan Yunis, una delle città della Striscia più pesantemente bombardate da Israele durante la guerra cominciata in seguito ai violenti attacchi di Hamas dello scorso 7 ottobre, che si trova nella parte meridionale del territorio. Sempre secondo le autorità sanitarie della Striscia, finora nella guerra sono state uccise più di 34mila persone e alcune migliaia risultano disperse.\n\n– Leggi anche: I civili a Rafah non sanno più

reveal.\n\nMcCloud, 65, bought the rural hideaway - which came with planning permission to convert a cow shed into another new home - for £1.1 million in June 2021.\n\nPlanning documents highlight how McCloud set out to restore the 'lost dignity and historic character' of the 400-year old Grade II listed property in Herefordshire.\n\nHis bold intentions for the timber-framed property may come as a surprise to some after McCloud admitted this week that he had spent a year working evenings and weekends to install a new IKEA kitchen.\n\nHe told how he put in the 'carcass and doors' and did some 'basic carpentry and screwing together' before adding that he brought in 'proper craftspeople' to customise it and bought a 'very, very beautiful, expensive hot water tap'.\n\n+\n15\nView

snapped up the property after splitting with his wife of 23 years and tying the knot with businesswoman Jenny Jones.\n\nA previous owner of the farmhouse, which dates from around 1600, was prosecuted for undertaking a major series of 'disrespectful' alterations without planning permission.\n\nREAD MORE: Can't afford a house?

Grand Designs star Kevin McCloud tells first time buyers to relocate because of country's 'healthy' property market\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPlanners said the unauthorised works led to 'irreparable loss of historic fabric which has compromised its character as a building of special historic and architectural interest'.\n\nDespite this, estate agents were keen to highlight the positive selling points of the property when it went on the market in 2021.\n\nThe 4,858 square foot farmhouse was advertised through Country Life magazine after a local estate agent who specialises in the sales of country houses and equestrian property was instructed to sell it.\n\nDescribed as a 'secluded, spacious farmhouse situated in a superb rural location' with 'land available separately', a series of glossy photographs showed off its 'charming and generously proportioned' layout.\n\nHighlights included the farmhouse's two 'very generously sized reception rooms' with the main sitting room opening from the 'kitchen/breakfast room' and featuring 'a wonderful inglenook fireplace with wood burner' and 'a snug nook'.\n\nA second reception room also featured a fireplace with wood burner and offered 'a versatile space'.\n\nAn online brochure added: 'A superb, spacious open-plan kitchen/breakfast room forms the heart of this house; the country-style oak fitted kitchen offers plenty of storage and also benefits from a large central island with granite work surface.'\n\nThe kitchen included an electric range cooker and the ground floor featured further rooms including study, utility room and boot room as well as two WC. \n\n+\n15\nView gallery\n\nA look at the Grade II listed property before it received a makeover from the television presenter\n\n+\n15\nView gallery\n\nFather-of-four McCloud snapped up the property, pictured, after splitting with his wife of 23 years\n\n+\n15\nView gallery\n\nThe presenter admitted this week that he had spent a year working evenings and weekends to install a new IKEA kitchen.

Historic ruin with 14 acres listed for £295k\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLast week he insisted he would never throw open his doors to TV viewers adding: 'It's like walking around with your trousers down'.\n\nBut in a teasing insight into his own personal project, McCloud told how he had been inspired to copy a restoration featured in an episode of Grand Designs.\n\nHe said he was 'absolutely blown away' by the transformation of the ruins of Astley Castle in Warwickshire after it was destroyed in a fire in the 1970s.\n\nMcCloud was particularly impressed with the inclusion of a contemporary 'hanging' oak staircase among its updated features.\n\nCouncil documents show that within weeks of buying the farmhouse, McCloud submitted detailed plans to make some major changes to the interior in a bid to restore it to its former glory.\n\nMcCloud's project includes new staircases on the ground and first floor to help create an area that 'should respond well to a sympathetic contemporary solution' to the previous botched works.\n\nThe documents show plans for the kitchen to be moved 'to the north wing' while permission was sought to turn one of the first floor's double bedrooms into a huge bathroom with 'his and hers' sinks and a freestanding bath in the centre of the room. \n\n+\n15\nView gallery\n\nThe first floor features three double bedrooms and a single bedroom.

Pictured: A bathroom before it was redesigned\n\nOther proposals include removing 'false ceilings' to expose historic beams along with the removal of 'modern cement and plaster' to 'reverse the damage caused by the use of modern previous materials'.\n\nThe plans show the removal of partition walls and 'blocking doorways' to reconfigure layouts as well as 'a more sympathetic solution to the altered main fireplaces'.\n\nOutside, the proposals included replacing modern brickwork with a timber-framed wall using traditional materials, landscaping gardens and the removal of the property's oil tank and its replacement with a heat pump to 'make an important contribution to the building's sustainability'.\n\nREAD MORE: From very Grand Designs.. to shopping at Ikea: Host Kevin McCloud reveals he's a fan of the Swedish furniture\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArchitectural historian and historic building consultant Dr Catherine Gordon said the proposals represented 'an important opportunity' to regain some of the property's 'former integrity following a phase of inappropriate alterations'.\n\nIn a heritage statement written to support the application, which was approved by Herefordshire Council in March 2022, she wrote of the staircase feature: 'The proposed works will address the issues raised by the awkward insertion of the modern staircase, which does not occupy the full width of the stairwell and has altered the layout of the first-floor landing.\n\n'A sympathetic solution that relates to the historic fabric and layout will dramatically improve this key central area within the house and the extent of recent alterations provides scope for an interesting contemporary design that underlines the house's dramatic proportions and robust character.'\n\nShe said the plans 'should serve to protect the building's surviving historic fabric, restore part of its original layout, improve its sustainability, and ensure it is adapted with an informed and careful approach to meet modern requirements'.\n\nDr Gordon added: 'They will set an important and valuable precedent for future alterations and repairs to this building that will continue to restore some of its lost dignity and historic character and increase both its individual significance and also that of its exceptional setting.' \n\n+\n15\nView gallery\n\nKevin McCloud, pictured inside the 'Grand House of Ideas' as part of Grand Designs Live in May\n\n+\n15\nView gallery\n\nThe 64-year-old pictured in the kitchen of his former home in Somerset in April 2004\n\n+\n15\nView gallery\n\nHost Kevin McCloud said in an episode in May 2023 that he has never spent more than £7,000 on a new kitchen. Here he is pictured speaking to a homeowner on the show\n\nMcCloud told how being without a kitchen for a year gave him an appreciation of the rollercoaster of emotions faced by participants of the home building show.\n\nHe said: 'It's hard to express and to understand, there was a very deep sense of threat.\n\n'It came from the fact that we didn't have a kitchen, we didn't have a heart to the home.\n\n'It was as though something had been taken away from the building that made it feel more dangerous to be there. I can't describe it in any other way, and I talk to people about this - it's a very common feeling.'\n\nMcCloud has spoken of his love for 'ancient buildings' and has said of his new home: 'It's a bit of a new build, a bit of an old build, a bit of a garden build and a bit of a barn conversion.\n\n'Ancient buildings are fabulous, but like elderly relatives, they do not thank you. And they're smelly and damp like elderly relatives. It's like living with a lunatic.'\n\nHe also said: 'My great love is old buildings and I get hot under the collar if I see people doing stuff which is not good. I'll wade in.'\n\nMcCloud had previously shared a 500-year-old farmhouse with second wife Suzanna near Bruton in Somerset.\n\nThe couple, who have two children, sold their previous Grade II-listed

Va detto che è indagato e che al momento il provvedimento a suo carico è di custodia cautelare. Ma la sinistra e i giornaloni che strizzano l'occhio ai progressisti fanno festa. C'è forse sete di vendetta dopo lo scandalo pugliese. E così si leggono titolo che hanno già il sapore di sentenze, il tutto senza neppure l'accenno di un minimo garantismo. Come ha raccontato il direttore editoriale di Libero, Daniele Capezzone, il nostro quotidiano si è posto degli interrogativi cercando anche di sottolineare quali sono gli aspetti che non tornano di questa vicenda.\n\nE su quanto accaduto è intervenuto il presidente dei senatori di Forza Italia, Maurizio Gasparri: \"Con tutti i dubbi che i fatti ci daranno poi modo di affrontare penso che ci siano vicende e vicende. Nel caso di Toti penso che uno che si vuole far corrompere non registra, ai sensi di legge, il contributo di un importante imprenditore nella raccolta fondi per la campagna elettorale. Ora la giornalista Claudia Fusani, dice che Toti nel 2020, mai indagato dall’Antimafia, era stato oggetto degli accessi di Striano. Quello, per esempio, é scandalo di cui non abbiamo più saputo niente\", ha affermato ad Agorà su Rai 3.\n\nPoi ha aggiunto: \"Sarà tutto da vedere ma io ho rafforzato il mio garantismo dopo che il senatore di Forza Italia, Siclari, venne accusato di voto di scambio e condannato in primo grado a 5 anni. Motivo per il quale, di comune accordo, non lo ricandidammo alle elezioni. Siclari poi venne assolto in appello, senza neanche un ricorso in Cassazione da parte di quei magistrati. Ora il senatore Siclari è completamente assolto ed innocente, ma non è più senatore perché non lo abbiamo ricandidato. Quindi a quelli che mozzano le teste direi di contare almeno fino a dieci\".

giorno fa, mentre oggi arriva la conferma ufficiale: AstraZeneca ha comunicato di aver ritirato a livello mondiale il suo vaccino contro il Covid-19. Il colosso della farmaceutica ha poi aggiunto che procederà al ritiro delle autorizzazioni alla messa in commercio di Vaxzevria, questo il nome del siero, in Europa.\n\nAstraZeneca spiega la decisione parlando di \"eccedenza di vaccini aggiornati disponibili\". A fine aprile, inoltre, la società ha ammesso per la prima volta - lo testimoniano alcuni documenti giudiziari nel corso di un procedimento legale a Londra - che il vaccino poteva causare trombosi come rarissimo effetto collaterale, circostanza riportata già in precedenti report dallo stesso gruppo.\n\nIl punto è che aver messo nero su bianco il possibile effetto collaterale in un documento giudiziario, secondo quanto stanno rilanciando in questi minuti i media britannici, potrebbe aprire la strada a risarcimenti multimilionari che potrebbe ottenere chi riuscirà a dimostrare di avere avuto una trombosi proprio come effetto collaterale dell'inoculazione del vaccino AstraZeneca.\n\nIl colosso farmaceutico, come detto, in tribunale ha spiegato che il siero può causare coaguli di sangue e un basso numero di piastrine. In ogni caso, sul rapporto rischi-benefici, un report basato su dati italiani e britannici mette in evidenza che la bilancia penderebbe nettamente a favore dei secondi, ragione per la quale era proseguito il piano di somministrazioni.

In un'intervista a La Stampa, il \"reggente\" che ha preso il posto di Toti, sospeso dalle sue funzioni amministrative, spiega: \"Non ho la sfera di cristallo, non so quello che può succedere politicamente in base anche agli eventuali sviluppi. Ribadisco che mi auguro che tutto possa essere chiarito il prima possibile per quanto riguarda il presidente, perché io sono garantista sempre ma soprattutto fiducioso sul suo operato.

Non mi esprimo sull'inchiesta così come non ho voluto commentare le vicissitudini surreali che riguardavano il sottoscritto, quando sarebbe stato facile e opportuno farlo, non l'ho fatto per rispetto degli organi inquirenti e per lo stesso motivo non lo farò oggi\".

di vaccino in tutto il mondo\nCondividi\nAggiungi ai preferiti\n(AP Photo/Alastair Grant, File)\n\nMartedì l’azienda farmaceutica britannico-svedese AstraZeneca ha detto di aver iniziato a ritirare le proprie dosi di vaccino in tutto il mondo: ha motivato la decisione col fatto che dalla pandemia in poi sono stati sviluppati molti altri vaccini più aggiornati, specifici per le nuove varianti del virus, e che questo ha portato a un calo della domanda per il vaccino Vaxzevria, quello sviluppato da AstraZeneca. L’azienda aveva chiesto il ritiro dell’autorizzazione alla commercializzazione lo scorso 5 marzo: il ritiro è diventato effettivo ieri, martedì 7 maggio.\n\nNegli ultimi anni al vaccino di AstraZeneca erano stati attribuiti effetti collaterali che provocavano coaguli di sangue e problemi circolatori, e l’azienda era stata citata in giudizio da decine di persone che avevano avuto reazioni avverse, compresi alcuni decessi.\n\nAd aprile del 2021 l’Agenzia europea dei medicinali (EMA), l’agenzia dell’Unione Europea che si occupa di farmaci, aveva detto che quelle reazioni, comunque molto rare rispetto al numero di somministrazioni effettuate, potevano essere effettivamente attribuite al vaccino di AstraZeneca. I fattori di rischio sembravano maggiori nelle persone più giovani, motivo per cui alcuni paesi avevano limitato la somministrazione del vaccino alle persone più anziane. L’EMA aveva comunque ribadito che i benefici offerti dal vaccino, ritenuto sicuro ed efficace, continuavano a superare gli eventuali rischi derivanti dalla sua somministrazione, specialmente se confrontati con quelli molto più alti che si affrontano nel caso in cui ci si ammali di COVID-19.\n\n– Leggi anche: Cosa sappiamo sulle trombosi e i

e-gates in arrivals halls failed to open.","article_body":"The UK airport chaos continued into a second day last night with more queues as border staff had to process people manually after the passport IT system collapsed nationwide.\n\nThousands of fed-up passengers were left stranded in Britain's airportsafter e-gates in arrivals halls failed to open. \n\nDisastrous scenes saw disgruntled travellers crowded into small corridors as they waited to have their ID records checked, while flustered members of staff frantically handed out water.\n\nMeanwhile planes due to take off and fly into the UK were grounded amid the chaos. Passengers in Girona were told their Ryanair jet was being held in Spain due to the gates disaster at its intended destination airport Stansted. \n\nThe 'major, major incident' appears to have been caused by the Border Force's security database called 'Border Crossing' which was introduced three years ago, costing the taxpayer £372million.\n\nJust after 2.10am this morning Home Office said it had finally fixed the system and had no evidence its outage had been caused by a cyber attack. But the queues were still enormous and will take time to clear.\n\nIf Border Crossing is shut down, e-gates cannot function, so Border Force staff had to check passports manually against back-up databases, checking travellers' names against terrorism records, the Police National Computer and immigration records.\n\n'Clearly this is a major, major incident because you don't expect this system to go down for any length of time across the board,' a source said before the problem was fixed.\n\nWere you caught up in the queues?

'We've been sat on the plane for 80 minutes. We are hopefully taking off soon but I'm not looking forward to the other end.'\n\nShe said she had already been notified about the Border Force delays in the Ryanair app, with the airline telling passengers they would likely have to 'remain onboard the aircraft for a short period of time until the passport control area is less crowded' once they land in the UK.\n\nPassengers were also prevented from disembarking dozens of aircraft after landing at Heathrow last night, it is understood.\n\nThey were unable to leave the planes because of the crisis unfolding in the terminals, where thousands of passengers were queueing in corridors and in the arrivals halls.\n\nThe crash appeared to have been caused by a failure in the official government wi-fi network which provides secure real-time updates to the security systems, insiders said.\n\nThe Border Crossing security database has also collapsed, it was confirmed. 'The secure wi-fi has gone down which means the systems can't update,' the source said. \n\n'They rely on wi-fi for notifications of someone who is known to be travelling to Britain who needs to be stopped, for whatever reason. Without those updates the egates can't keep up to date with real-time security issues.'\n\n+\n28\nView gallery\n\nHandout photo issued by Paul Curievici of Gatwick Airport yesterday evening at passport control\n\n+\n28\nView gallery\n\nFelix Ostman, 30, who has just arrived at Heathrow Airport on a flight from Oslo around 9pm, told MailOnline: 'I've just got here and it's totally chaos, with waiting times over an hour' (pictured: queues at Heathrow)\n\n'It took me an hour and a half': Passenger describes UK airport outage\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\n0:00\nPrevious\nPlay\nSkip\nMute\nCurrent Time\n0:00\n/\nDuration Time\n1:52\nFullscreen\nNeed Text\n+\n28\nView gallery\n\nKylee Charles, who was among those stuck in queues at Gatwick, told MailOnline: 'We were caught up in the chaos.

But then there was a massive scrum of people and we could see the e-gates were not working.\n\n'They then announced that due to a computer issue the e-gates were not working so they had to adopt manual desks.\n\n'The problem is there are hundreds of people here winding back and forward in the lanes waiting to get someone to check their passports.\n\nRead More\nBritain's broken borders: Watchdog reports expose shocking migration system failings, with airport passport checks left unmanned \n\n'There are obviously still planes landing coming through making their way to the same pinchpoint.\n\n'People are being typically British and taking it on the chin.

It's not a great welcome back to the UK for Brits or people coming to our country.\n\n'I have Italian tourists and German people behind me and I wonder what they think as they arrive into the UK.\n\n'They seem that they are relieving the pressure a bit and moving a lot more than it was. It's obviously affecting all the other airports.'\n\nKylee Charles, who was among those stuck in queues at Gatwick, told MailOnline: 'We were caught up in the chaos. We've only just got out of Gatwick after waiting in huge queues of disgruntled travellers. \n\n'The Gatwick team took a while to get their back-up plan up and running, which consisted of a series laptops and what appeared to be additional staff; who were all calm and collected.'\n\nAnother passenger, Jenny, had been flying from Copenhagen to Edinburgh Airport with RyanAir when the e-gates suddenly closed.\n\n'We were corralled in passport control and the e-gate passport machines were rejecting everyone telling them to seek assistance,' Jenny told MailOnline.\n\n'The machines were then turned off and the person who was managing the queue was apologetic, saying they were understaffed and he didn't know what was going on. It appeared to be a problem to manually process people.\n\n'Finally, and this was quite a while later, they decided to manually process people, but all in all it was a shambolic welcome to Scotland. Really embarrassing and a very poor impression of Edinburgh Airport.'\n\nFelix Ostman, 30, who has just arrived at Heathrow Airport on a flight from Oslo around 9pm last night, told MailOnline: 'I've just got here and it's totally chaos, with waiting times over an hour. \n\n'The e-gates are now working and UK/EU/US/Australia citizens are asked to use them, however the line is massive. Other nationalities are handled manually by the Border Force.'\n\nAfter more than an hour, Felix said he only moved about 30 metres - despite announcements that the e-gates were up and running again.\n\n+\n28\nView gallery\n\nPeople at Edinburgh Airport were checking their phones for updates as they waited to be processed \n\n+\n28\nView gallery\n\nPeople can be seen taking pictures and videos of the crowds at Heathrow Airport last night\n\n+\n28\nView gallery\n\nThousands of people were neatly waiting in line at Heathrow airport, among them Felix Ostman, who expected to be stuck in the queue for 'a few hours'\n\n+\n28\nView gallery\n\nTired passengers were waiting in the hour-long queues at airports across the UK \n\n+\n28\nView gallery\n\nMailOnline reporter Rebecca Lawrence was among those stuck in the Gatwick queues.

People started shouting to let out people with tiny babies at the back'\n\n'There are just so many people here,' he told MailOnline. 'I'm quite young - I think it is quite a bit worse for others, like people with young children in the queue that will have to be here for hours. I just want to get home, too.'\n\nDue to the massive queues ahead of him, Felix expected to be stuck at Heathrow 'a few more hours'.\n\nAnother passenger, Ella Blake, who arrived at Liverpool Airport last night, said: 'The systems went down as our flight's passengers were going through security.'\n\nShe added that 'staff were as quick as they could' as they moved arrivals through. \n\nGemma O'Kelly, 40, had been travelling from Faro in Portugal to Stansted with her five children when she got caught up in the delays.\n\nThe event planner told MailOnline last night: 'The airport suddenly said systems were down and that they would check people through manually, however, they had no power at all.\n\n'We waited 90 minutes but the queues will have people waiting for hours. They said it was a counter-terrorism procedure and that all systems in the UK had gone down, every port and airport in the UK had lost power to their systems. ... They didn't mention an incident just that their computers had lost power.'\n\nThe mother-of-five, who was travelling with her partner and children who are between the ages of one and 15, said there were a 'load of babies crying' as more and more people joined the queues for the manual gates.\n\n'It was just frustrating as we were told 10 minutes then nothing for 30 minutes,' Ms O'Kelly said. \n\n'They kept saying they would be manually checking people through but nothing was happening for around 1 hour and 20. The others will be there much longer.'\n\nMailOnline reporter Rebecca Lawrence was among those stuck in the Gatwick queues. \n\nShe said around 11pm last night: 'I've only been in the queue for about ten minutes thus far and honestly, it doesn't look as bad as Heathrow, so I'm feeling lucky about that! But it is roasting and everyone is irritated.'\n\n'We have been given no updates or explanation from any staff. They are just shouting at us to move to the right so the mobility cars can get through,' she added.\n\nWhen announcements finally came via the tannoy, the airport thanked passengers for their patience.  \n\nMs Lawrence said about the experience: 'Families tried to get to the front but staff said there were no special queues for children. People started shouting to let out people with tiny babies at the back.' \n\n+\n28\nView gallery\n\nRows of luggage were seen at Heathrow Airport last night as passengers were stuck in long Border Force queues for hours\n\n+\n28\nView gallery\n\nPassengers arriving back in to the uk at Terminal 5 yesterday evening faced three- to four-hour delays getting through passport control due to technical issues\n\n+\n28\nView gallery\n\nPassengers started to make their way through border control into the arrivals hall at Heathrow Airport around 10pm as Border Force officers manually processed them\n\n+\n28\nView gallery\n\nA few people came out of the arrivals terminal at Heathrow at 10pm last night as their passports were manually processed\n\n+\n28\nView gallery\n\nMeanwhile many were waiting outside arrivals to pick up passengers stuck in the long queues for the Border Force last night\n\n+\n28\nView gallery\n\nHolidaymakers slowly came through the arrivals hall at Heathrow as their awaiting minicabs and chauffeurs faced a large bill for parking in the short term car parks for hours last night\n\nShe added that people were 'stuck in a bottle neck queuing in the tunnels in the heat', but once passengers reached the main concourse 'everyone sped through quite quickly.'\n\nSam Morter, 32, who landed at Heathrow's Terminal 3 at around 7.30pm from Sri Lanka, said he saw airport staff 'scrambling' to sort the situation after the technical issue caused significant disruption at airports across the country.\n\nHe said: 'We headed to passport control where it already started to become pandemonium in there. All of the e-gates had just gone down and all of them had blank screens.\n\n'There was a lot of Border Force officials running and scrambling around. Four or five went to man the posts and start processing the UK passports manually. \n\n'But at the same time, hundreds of passengers started to flood into passport control, so it all of a sudden became chaotic and they couldn't cope with the number of the people coming in.'\n\n'A lot of disgruntled, angry and frustrated passengers and people coming off of long-haul flights very tired, so that didn't help. Not great scenes,' he added.\n\nRyanair had warned passengers due to arrive at UK airports about the delays in their app last night.\n\nRead More\nTwo thirds of UK adults are unaware of new EU biometric border controls set to be enforced for Brit holidaymakers from October this year, survey reveals \n\nThe notification read: 'Please be advised that the Electronic Passport gates are temporarily unavailable at all UK Airports. You may experience extended queue times at passport control in airports in the United Kingdom as a result of this outage.'\n\nA Heathrow Airport spokesperson said in a statement last night: 'Border Force is currently experiencing a nationwide issue which is impacting passengers being processed through the Border. \n\n'Our teams are supporting Border Force with their contingency plans to help resolve the problem as quickly as possible and are on hand to provide passenger welfare. We apologise for any impact this is having to passenger journeys.'\n\nManchester Airport's statement read: 'We are aware of an issue with UK Border Force's systems across the country, affecting a significant number of airports. \n\n'Our Resilience Team and customer services colleagues are supporting passengers while UK Border Force and the Home Office fix the issue.'\n\nEdinburgh Airport said in a statement: 'Border Force is experiencing a nationwide technical outage affecting UK airports. \n\n'Although not in a peak arrivals period, some passengers may experience longer than normal waits at the border while UKBF works to fix the issue. Thank you for your patience.' \n\nStansted Airport said in their statement: 'We are aware of an issue with UK Border Force's systems across the country, affecting all UK airports. \n\n'Our operational and customer service colleagues are supporting passengers while UK Border Force and the Home Office fix the issue.'\n\nA Home Office spokesperson told MailOnline last night: 'We are aware of a technical issue affecting e-gates across the country.\n\n'We are working closely with Border Force and affected airports to resolve the issue as soon as possible and apologise to all passengers for the inconvenience caused.'\n\nThe Border Crossing system suffered repeated crashes leading to massive queues at Heathrow when it was introduced in summer 2021.\n\nMore recently there were queues of more than an hour at Stansted arrivals halls on April 25 after the e-gates all failed.\n\nBorder Crossing was rushed into use – when it was already three years late – because new requirements to check EU travellers in the same way as other international passengers could not be carried out by the database it replaced, the Warnings Index.\n\nThe Warnings Index is still available as a back-up but is due to be switched off permanently soon, it is understood.\n\nThe Commons' Public Accounts Committee looked at Border Crossing in March 2021 and warned the Home Office had 'no proof that systems can

stranded in airports following Border Force chaos","description":"Exhausted children were 'left without food or water for hours' at UK airports this morning after the passport IT system collapsed nationwide.","article_body":"Families who waited hours with no 'food or water' following Border Force chaos at UK airports this morning were forced to wait hours more outside or even bed down for the night due to a lack of transport options after clearing security. \n\nYesterday the passport IT system collapsed 'nationwide' forcing border staff to process thousands of passengers manually causing hours of delays and making many passengers miss airport connections and National Express services home. \n\nThe fault with the e-gates began late yesterday evening and wasn't resolved until 2am, stranding passengers in ever lengthening queues in arrivals halls and in some cases trapping them on planes. \n\nThe 'major, major incident' appears to have been caused by the Border Force's security database called 'Border Crossing' which was introduced three years ago, costing the taxpayer £372million.\n\nJust after 2.10am this morning Home Office said it had finally fixed the system and had no evidence its outage had been caused by a cyber attack.\n\nHowever for many the ordeal was only just beginning with queues for coaches and taxis leaving the airport also lasting hours, forcing many passengers to bed down on the floor.\n\nAfter clearing the border, passengers at Stanstead were forced to wait for hours more outside for the 4:30am National Express train back to London. \n\nThe fallout from the disruption continues with many passengers expressing their disbelief at the lack of an adequate back up plan in place that resulted in some queuing for longer at the border than they spent on their flight from Lisbon. \n\nAt Stanstead airport the situation was particularly desperate, with mother Joanna Griffin telling The Mirror that 'loads of children were waiting without water or food.'  \n\nReacting to their predicament in Heathrow arrivals, one passenger told GMB: 'It's absolutely tragic, an absolute mockery out of all of us.'\n\nAnother revealed the stomach churning moment they realised they were in a long wait, saying: ''As soon as we get to the airport we're greeted by queues and this one guy saying there's going be at least a two and a half hour wait.'\n\nWere

Supposedly there's a back up system but I imagine if the first fails and the second, maybe the third is not so good as well.'\n\nOne Heathrow passenger claimed that the situation was further jeopardised by a bathroom fault. \n\nThe told the Mirror: 'We haven't been given any refreshments yet. The toilet taps actually ran out of water, so people have had to use bottled water to wash their hands!' \n\nOne passenger flying into Stanstead from Murcia in Spain told MailOnline that after arriving they spent one hour on the tarmac before two hours in a queue. \n\nShe said: 'Some people tried to push in or jump the queues, but the police were great in stopping them.' \n\nDisastrous scenes saw disgruntled travellers crowded into small corridors as they waited to have their ID records checked, while flustered members of staff frantically handed out water.\n\nIf Border Crossing is shut down, e-gates cannot function, so Border Force staff had to check passports manually against back-up databases, checking travellers' names against terrorism records, the Police National Computer and immigration records.\n\n'Clearly this is a major, major incident because you don't expect this system to go down for any length of time across the board,' a source said before the problem was fixed.\n\n'The involvement of major airports in different parts of the country, from Gatwick to Manchester, suggests this is a nationwide system crash.\n\n'If both Border Crossing and the back-up system are affected it would mean issuing laptops to officers on the PCP [primary control point], which will slow things down even further.'\n\nThe unprecedented situation engulfed airports across the country, with photos shared on social media showing enormous lines of passengers in front of the gates at airports like Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Luton, Edinburgh and Manchester. \n\nWhile some of the e-gates appeared to be coming back online overnight - for example at Heathrow - other passengers were bracing for queues lasting hours.\n\nFootage shared on social media shows the moment the e-gates reopened at Heathrow, with passengers smiling and clapping as the first people enter the automated passport control cubicles. \n\nThe system outage also impacted flights due to land in the UK last night. \n\nJenny Coxall was due to fly to Stansted on a Ryanair flight from the Spanish city of Girona, but she said her flight was 'being held [there] because of the Border Force gates outage'.\n\n'It looks like we are in for a very long night,' Jenny told MailOnline last night around 11pm. 'We've been sat on the plane for 80 minutes. We are hopefully taking off soon but I'm not looking forward to the other end.'\n\nShe said she had already been notified about the Border Force delays in the Ryanair app, with the airline telling passengers they would likely have to 'remain onboard the aircraft for a short period of time until the passport control area is less crowded' once they land in the UK.\n\nPassengers were also prevented from disembarking dozens of aircraft after landing at Heathrow last night, it is understood.\n\nThey were unable to leave the planes because of the crisis unfolding in the terminals, where thousands of passengers were queueing in corridors and in the arrivals halls.\n\nThe crash appeared to have been caused by a failure in the official government wi-fi network which provides secure real-time updates to the security systems, insiders said.\n\nThe Border Crossing security database has also collapsed, it was confirmed. 'The secure wi-fi has gone down which means the systems can't update,' the source said. \n\n'They rely on wi-fi for notifications of someone who is known to be travelling to Britain who needs to be stopped, for whatever reason. Without those updates the egates can't keep up to date with real-time security issues.'\n\n+\n35\nView gallery\n\nPassengers said they were outraged by the way they had been treated \n\n+\n35\nView gallery\n\nOthers expressed hopelessness that any of the back up plans would clear the backlog quickly \n\n+\n35\nView gallery\n\nHandout photo issued by Paul Curievici of Gatwick Airport yesterday evening at passport control\n\n+\n35\nView gallery\n\nFelix Ostman, 30, who has just arrived at Heathrow Airport on a flight from Oslo around 9pm, told MailOnline: 'I've just got here and it's totally chaos, with waiting times over an hour' (pictured: queues at Heathrow)\n\n'It took me an hour and a half': Passenger describes UK airport outage\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\n0:00\nPrevious\nPlay\nSkip\nMute\nCurrent Time\n0:00\n/\nDuration Time\n1:52\nFullscreen\nNeed Text\n+\n35\nView gallery\n\nKylee Charles, who was among those stuck in queues at Gatwick, told MailOnline: 'We were caught up in the chaos.

But then there was a massive scrum of people and we could see the e-gates were not working.\n\n'They then announced that due to a computer issue the e-gates were not working so they had to adopt manual desks.\n\n'The problem is there are hundreds of people here winding back and forward in the lanes waiting to get someone to check their passports.\n\nRead More\nBritain's broken borders: Watchdog reports expose shocking migration system failings, with airport passport checks left unmanned \n\n'There are obviously still planes landing coming through making their way to the same pinchpoint.\n\n'People are being typically British and taking it on the chin.

It's not a great welcome back to the UK for Brits or people coming to our country.\n\n'I have Italian tourists and German people behind me and I wonder what they think as they arrive into the UK.\n\n'They seem that they are relieving the pressure a bit and moving a lot more than it was. It's obviously affecting all the other airports.'\n\nKylee Charles, who was among those stuck in queues at Gatwick, told MailOnline: 'We were caught up in the chaos. We've only just got out of Gatwick after waiting in huge queues of disgruntled travellers. \n\n'The Gatwick team took a while to get their back-up plan up and running, which consisted of a series laptops and what appeared to be additional staff; who were all calm and collected.'\n\nAnother passenger, Jenny, had been flying from Copenhagen to Edinburgh Airport with RyanAir when the e-gates suddenly closed.\n\n'We were corralled in passport control and the e-gate passport machines were rejecting everyone telling them to seek assistance,' Jenny told MailOnline.\n\n'The machines were then turned off and the person who was managing the queue was apologetic, saying they were understaffed and he didn't know what was going on. It appeared to be a problem to manually process people.\n\n'Finally, and this was quite a while later, they decided to manually process people, but all in all it was a shambolic welcome to Scotland. Really embarrassing and a very poor impression of Edinburgh Airport.'\n\nFelix Ostman, 30, who has just arrived at Heathrow Airport on a flight from Oslo around 9pm last night, told MailOnline: 'I've just got here and it's totally chaos, with waiting times over an hour. \n\n'The e-gates are now working and UK/EU/US/Australia citizens are asked to use them, however the line is massive. Other nationalities are handled manually by the Border Force.'\n\nAfter more than an hour, Felix said he only moved about 30 metres - despite announcements that the e-gates were up and running again.\n\n+\n35\nView gallery\n\nPeople at Edinburgh Airport were checking their phones for updates as they waited to be processed \n\n+\n35\nView gallery\n\nPeople can be seen taking pictures and videos of the crowds at Heathrow Airport last night\n\n+\n35\nView gallery\n\nThousands of people were neatly waiting in line at Heathrow airport, among them Felix Ostman, who expected to be stuck in the queue for 'a few hours'\n\n+\n35\nView gallery\n\nTired passengers were waiting in the hour-long queues at airports across the UK \n\n+\n35\nView gallery\n\nMailOnline reporter Rebecca Lawrence was among those stuck in the Gatwick queues.

People started shouting to let out people with tiny babies at the back'\n\n'There are just so many people here,' he told MailOnline. 'I'm quite young - I think it is quite a bit worse for others, like people with young children in the queue that will have to be here for hours. I just want to get home, too.'\n\nDue to the massive queues ahead of him, Felix expected to be stuck at Heathrow 'a few more hours'.\n\nAnother passenger, Ella Blake, who arrived at Liverpool Airport last night, said: 'The systems went down as our flight's passengers were going through security.'\n\nShe added that 'staff were as quick as they could' as they moved arrivals through. \n\nGemma O'Kelly, 40, had been travelling from Faro in Portugal to Stansted with her five children when she got caught up in the delays.\n\nThe event planner told MailOnline last night: 'The airport suddenly said systems were down and that they would check people through manually, however, they had no power at all.\n\n'We waited 90 minutes but the queues will have people waiting for hours. They said it was a counter-terrorism procedure and that all systems in the UK had gone down, every port and airport in the UK had lost power to their systems. ... They didn't mention an incident just that their computers had lost power.'\n\nThe mother-of-five, who was travelling with her partner and children who are between the ages of one and 15, said there were a 'load of babies crying' as more and more people joined the queues for the manual gates.\n\n'It was just frustrating as we were told 10 minutes then nothing for 30 minutes,' Ms O'Kelly said. \n\n'They kept saying they would be manually checking people through but nothing was happening for around 1 hour and 20. The others will be there much longer.'\n\nMailOnline reporter Rebecca Lawrence was among those stuck in the Gatwick queues. \n\nShe said around 11pm last night: 'I've only been in the queue for about ten minutes thus far and honestly, it doesn't look as bad as Heathrow, so I'm feeling lucky about that! But it is roasting and everyone is irritated.'\n\n'We have been given no updates or explanation from any staff. They are just shouting at us to move to the right so the mobility cars can get through,' she added.\n\nWhen announcements finally came via the tannoy, the airport thanked passengers for their patience.  \n\nMs Lawrence said about the experience: 'Families tried to get to the front but staff said there were no special queues for children. People started shouting to let out people with tiny babies at the back.' \n\n+\n35\nView gallery\n\nRows of luggage were seen at Heathrow Airport last night as passengers were stuck in long Border Force queues for hours\n\n+\n35\nView gallery\n\nPassengers arriving back in to the uk at Terminal 5 yesterday evening faced three- to four-hour delays getting through passport control due to technical issues\n\n+\n35\nView gallery\n\nPassengers started to make their way through border control into the arrivals hall at Heathrow Airport around 10pm as Border Force officers manually processed them\n\n+\n35\nView gallery\n\nA few people came out of the arrivals terminal at Heathrow at 10pm last night as their passports were manually processed\n\n+\n35\nView gallery\n\nMeanwhile many were waiting outside arrivals to pick up passengers stuck in the long queues for the Border Force last night\n\n+\n35\nView gallery\n\nHolidaymakers slowly came through the arrivals hall at Heathrow as their awaiting minicabs and chauffeurs faced a large bill for parking in the short term car parks for hours last night\n\nShe added that people were 'stuck in a bottle neck queuing in the tunnels in the heat', but once passengers reached the main concourse 'everyone sped through quite quickly.'\n\nSam Morter, 32, who landed at Heathrow's Terminal 3 at around 7.30pm from Sri Lanka, said he saw airport staff 'scrambling' to sort the situation after the technical issue caused significant disruption at airports across the country.\n\nHe said: 'We headed to passport control where it already started to become pandemonium in there. All of the e-gates had just gone down and all of them had blank screens.\n\n'There was a lot of Border Force officials running and scrambling around. Four or five went to man the posts and start processing the UK passports manually. \n\n'But at the same time, hundreds of passengers started to flood into passport control, so it all of a sudden became chaotic and they couldn't cope with the number of the people coming in.'\n\n'A lot of disgruntled, angry and frustrated passengers and people coming off of long-haul flights very tired, so that didn't help. Not great scenes,' he added.\n\nRyanair had warned passengers due to arrive at UK airports about the delays in their app last night.\n\nRead More\nTwo thirds of UK adults are unaware of new EU biometric border controls set to be enforced for Brit holidaymakers from October this year, survey reveals \n\nThe notification read: 'Please be advised that the Electronic Passport gates are temporarily unavailable at all UK Airports. You may experience extended queue times at passport control in airports in the United Kingdom as a result of this outage.'\n\nA Heathrow Airport spokesperson said in a statement last night: 'Border Force is currently experiencing a nationwide issue which is impacting passengers being processed through the Border. \n\n'Our teams are supporting Border Force with their contingency plans to help resolve the problem as quickly as possible and are on hand to provide passenger welfare. We apologise for any impact this is having to passenger journeys.'\n\nManchester Airport's statement read: 'We are aware of an issue with UK Border Force's systems across the country, affecting a significant number of airports. \n\n'Our Resilience Team and customer services colleagues are supporting passengers while UK Border Force and the Home Office fix the issue.'\n\nEdinburgh Airport said in a statement: 'Border Force is experiencing a nationwide technical outage affecting UK airports. \n\n'Although not in a peak arrivals period, some passengers may experience longer than normal waits at the border while UKBF works to fix the issue. Thank you for your patience.' \n\nStansted Airport said in their statement: 'We are aware of an issue with UK Border Force's systems across the country, affecting all UK airports. \n\n'Our operational and customer service colleagues are supporting passengers while UK Border Force and the Home Office fix the issue.'\n\nA Home Office spokesperson told MailOnline last night: 'We are aware of a technical issue affecting e-gates across the country.\n\n'We are working closely with Border Force and affected airports to resolve the issue as soon as possible and apologise to all passengers for the inconvenience caused.'\n\nThe Border Crossing system suffered repeated crashes leading to massive queues at Heathrow when it was introduced in summer 2021.\n\nMore recently there were queues of more than an hour at Stansted arrivals halls on April 25 after the e-gates all failed.\n\nBorder Crossing was rushed into use – when it was already three years late – because new requirements to check EU travellers in the same way as other international passengers could not be carried out by the database it replaced, the Warnings Index.\n\nThe Warnings Index is still available as a back-up but is due to be switched off permanently soon, it is understood.\n\nThe Commons' Public Accounts Committee looked at Border Crossing in March 2021 and warned the Home Office had 'no proof that systems can

Ieri era in Campania. Domani sera sarà a Milano, al Teatro Dal Verme, da cui partì la campagna per le primarie del 2012. E la sfida non è certo meno complicata di allora. Dodici anni fa era scalare un partito che lo guardava di traverso (e non ha mai smesso). Ora è il sancta sanctorum dell’Europa, Bruxelles. In tutto questo, il fuoco amico arriva sempre dalla stessa parte: il Pd.\n\nSi è arrabbiato perché Elly Schlein ha detto di voler firmare il referendum della Cgil contro il Jobs Act. Però questa posizione era già nella mozione con cui vinse le primarie. E nel 2015 scese in piazza contro quella riforma. In fondo è coerente, no?\n«Il Pd ormai non esiste più o almeno non esiste quel grande partito riformista che aveva come stella polare il lavoro, la crescita, lo sviluppo e che è arrivato oltre il 40%. Adesso sono il partito delle tasse, delle manette e del reddito di cittadinanza. Si scrive Schlein, si legge CGIL. Ma non sono arrabbiato. Sapevamo bene che con Elly, come giustamente dice, si sarebbe spostata più a sinistra. Ma a me quello che sorprende non sono Schlein e le sue posizioni: a me sorprendono i riformisti del Pd».\n\n \n\n \n\nFabio Rubini: quando il Pd esultava per la legge che Elly Schlein odia\n\n \n\nHanno commentato che la decisione di Elly non impegna il partito. Che ne pensa?\n«Quella legge non solo creò oltre un milione di posti di lavoro e cancellò la vergogna delle dimissioni in bianco ma fu pensata, voluta, votata dal Pd. E che i riformisti - con l’eccezione della brava Marianna Madia, all’epoca responsabile lavoro- non abbiano altro da dire fa sorridere. Meglio per noi, comunque. Chi oggi è un moderato, un liberale, un riformista, vota per gli Stati Uniti d’Europa: se voti Pd, anche un candidato riformista, stai votando la sesta stella del Movimento Cinque Stelle».\n\nOggi è stato a Ercolano con il governatore della Campania Vincenzo De Luca. Cosa vi siete detti? Anche lui è contro il jobs act?\n«Non ne abbiamo parlato. Abbiamo inaugurato una bellissima iniziativa culturale del sindaco di Ercolano Ciro Buonajuto e abbiamo visto una comunità felice in festa. Posso immaginare cosa pensi Vincenzo De Luca della leadership di Elly Schlein, ma non essendo come è noto un tipo particolarmente diplomatico se vuole dire qualcosa, lo dirà lui».\n\nA proposito di riforme fatte dal suo governo, Meloni ha provato a copiarla con i 100 euro. In fondo dovrebbe essere contento: copiato persino dagli avversari...\n«Giorgia Meloni per anni ha chiamato gli 80 euro una mancetta: ora, lancia i 100 euro. Apparentemente sembrano la stessa cosa, migliorata. Ma non è affatto così. I nostri 80 euro erano netti. I 100 della Meloni lordi. I suoi sono annuali, i nostri mensili. I suoi sono per certe categorie sotto una certa soglia, i nostri per tutti sotto una certa soglia. I suoi sono attivabili a richiesta, i nostri automatici. Ma anche sul resto Meloni è una delusione: dalle tasse, alla giustizia, al premierato non c’è sul campo una sola riforma. Un liberale, oggi, non può che votare Stati Uniti d’Europa».\n\nOggi Goffredo Bettini, in un colloquio con il Corriere della Sera, dice che il Pd dovrebbe allearsi con un partito di centro, ma non con lei e Calenda perché siete “respingenti” anche tra di voi. Cosa risponde?\n«Questa idea di far fuori il centro è davvero geniale. È stata sperimentata con successo dallo statista Enrico Letta nel 2022: il risultato è che la coalizione della Meloni ha la maggioranza assoluta. Sono tecniche sadomasochiste per la sinistra che vengono apprezzate dalla destra. Che vince e ringrazia.\nFare a meno del centro è la stessa cosa che è stata sperimentata recentemente in Basilicata: se il Pd si fosse alleato con noi avrebbe vinto. Ha scelto i grillini e ha perso. Insomma: chi teorizza di fare accordi senza di noi perde. Goffredo Bettini si è auto nominato guru filosofico del Pd. Mi fa piacere per lui. Ultimamente tuttavia lo vedo più ferrato sulla vita politica thailandese che su quella italiana».\n\nMancano 33 giorni alle elezioni europee. Stati Uniti d’Europa e Azione sono le uniche liste a puntare nettamente sull’Europa. Però andate divisi. Non rischia di essere un terribile danno per entrambi?\n«Noi della lista Stati Uniti d’Europa siamo accreditati ben sopra la soglia di sbarramento: faremo un grande risultato. Lo stesso non posso dire di altri. Ma la parola agli elettori: nel nostro simbolo troveranno un progetto, quello degli Stati Uniti d’Europa, in quello di Azione un cognome. Noi degli Stati Uniti d’Europa se saremo eletti andremo al Parlamento Europeo. Calenda, come Tajani, Meloni, Schlein, no. Candidarsi sapendo che se eletti non si andrà in Europa significa truffare i cittadini. È una vergogna».\n\n \n\n \n\nVideo su questo argomento\n\nJobs Act, Renzi: \"Il PD non esiste più\"\n\n \n\nQual è precisamente la proposta degli Stati Uniti d’Europa?\n«Gli Stati Uniti d’Europa sono un progetto ambizioso. È chiaro che l’Ue, così come è, non può funzionare. Il mondo brucia e l’Europa non tocca palla. L’Europa non esiste in nessun dossier, è in mano ai burocrati che se va bene, non incidono. Se va male, si aggrappano alle ideologie dell’estremismo ambientalista e partoriscono il green deal, che non protegge l’ambiente ma distrugge i posti di lavoro. Noi proponiamo un’Europa più democratica, con l’elezione diretta del presidente della commissione, l’abolizione del diritto di veto che rende i Paesi ostaggio della volontà di pochi».\n\nMosca sta facendo esercitazioni nucleari. È solo un modo di mostrare i muscoli o è una minaccia reale?\n«Sono preoccupato. Ogni gesto di escalation verbale crea tensioni. Ogni iniziativa anche solo a scopo di esercitazione equivale a dislocare mine sul cammino della pace. Per me la soluzione è insistere sulla strada della difesa comune europea con l’obiettivo ambizioso dell’esercito europeo ma attivando anche un vero canale diplomatico a cominciare dalla figura dello special envoy per la guerra Ucraina che io nominerei scegliendo tra veri leader come Merkel o Blair. Una proposta che feci il giorno dopo la criminale aggressione della Russia all’Ucraina, assieme ovviamente all’invio di armi per Kiev e alle sanzioni per Mosca».\n\nHamas ha annunciato di aver accettato la proposta di un cessate il fuoco. Israele accetterà? Ci avviciniamo a una soluzione?\n«Io sono ottimista. La situazione nel Medio Oriente non è semplice. Ma i Paesi arabi moderati stanno giocando la partita in modo equilibrato e intelligente. E forse questa può essere davvero la volta buona di una pace che ci regali uno stato di Palestina e la sicurezza di Israele».\n\nCosa pensa delle proteste degli studenti che si stanno allargando in tutto il mondo, Italia compresa?\n«Vedere studenti che dalla comodità della loro posizione inneggiano a dei territoristi, impediscono di parlare a chi non la pensa come loro, spargono antisemitismo, nei luoghi di cultura, desta forte preoccupazione. Ma è un fenomeno che ha delle radici profonde. È nelle università americane che è nata la cancel culture, densa di sentimenti anti occidentali.

Il varco di Kerem Shalom, con Israele, era chiuso da domenica, dopo un attacco con razzi rivendicato da Hamas che aveva provocato la morte di quattro soldati israeliani e il ferimento di dieci. Dal varco, prima della sua chiusura, passavano oltre 120 camion di aiuti umanitari al giorno: con la chiusura si era di fatto bloccato il flusso di aiuti e di carburante, necessario per i generatori che forniscono l’energia elettrica.\n\nLa riapertura è stata favorita da forti pressioni del governo statunitense sul primo ministro israeliano Benjamin Nethanyahu. Il varco di Rafah con l’Egitto è però al momento ancora chiuso. L’esercito israeliano ha occupato la zona e si prepara all’invasione di terra della città, un’operazione particolarmente temuta per le conseguenze umanitarie che potrebbe avere sui circa 1,4 milioni di civili che si sono rifugiati lì, in fuga dalle altre città della Striscia già invase e bombardate da Israele.\n\nTag:\nHAMAS ISRAELE\n-\nISRAELE\n-\nKEREM SHALOM\nCONSIGLIATI\nLe città più grandi

Giorgetti: «Spalmare crediti su 10 anni sarà obbligo»","description":"«Gli emendamenti parlamentari di ampliamento delle deroghe non saranno presi in considerazione», ha aggiunto il ministro dell’Economia","article_body":"Arriva l’obbligo di spalmare su dieci anni i crediti derivati da lavori di superbonus. E, contemporaneamente, arriva la stretta su nuove deroghe al blocco delle cessioni, proposte dai parlamentari con gli emendamenti al decreto 39/2024 in conversione a Palazzo Madama. Sono gli elementi emersi dalle dichiarazioni del ministro dell’Economia, Giancarlo Giorgetti durante i lavori della commissione Finanze del Senato, proprio sul decreto Superbonus.\nLo spalmacrediti su dieci anni\n«Spalmare crediti su dieci anni - ha spiegato il ministro - non sarà una possibilità, ma un obbligo». Il riferimento è allo strumento già utilizzato in passato per consentire ai contribuenti di allungare il periodo di utilizzo, sia delle detrazioni che dei crediti di imposta di superbonus. Attualmente, questo strumento non è più attivo e anche dagli stessi parlamentari sono arrivate sollecitazioni a rimetterlo in moto, attraverso gli emendamenti al decreto. Emendamenti, però, tutti nel segno della volontarietà. Il Mef, invece, sta ragionando su uno strumento obbligatorio, che avrà la funzione di alleggerire il carico del debito nel 2024 e negli anni immediatamente successivi, per spostare il peso più in avanti.\nStop alle deroghe\nGiorgetti, poi, ha chiuso su possibili nuove deroghe al blocco delle cessioni: «Gli emendamenti parlamentari, come avvenuto in passato, di ampliamento delle deroghe non saranno presi in considerazione». Il riferimento è, principalmente, agli allargamenti proposti dai parlamentari a beneficio del Terzo settore e di chi vuole accedere al bonus barriere architettoniche. Diverse proposte, infatti, puntavano ad ammorbidire il durissimo blocco, imposto dall’esecutivo a fine marzo. Resta da capire, invece, cosa succederà per le zone sismiche: qui c’è in ballo l’ipotesi di allungare, a costi invariati, l’elenco delle Regioni che possono accede alle deroghe.\n«Lo anticipato andava proposto prima»\nPer Giorgetti, infine, «la soluzione proposta da Bankitalia di fermare il Superbonus prima della scadenza sarebbe stata gradita se fosse stata fatta magari nel 2022, nel 2023, nel 2021: arriva nel 2024 quando il governo sta esattamente procedendo a fare questo». Pochi giorni fa, infatti, la Banca d’Italia, nel corso delle audizioni, aveva evocato la possibilità di un blocco completo al superbonus se anche l’intervento previsto dal decreto 39/2024 dovesse,

tribunale d’appello di Hong Kong ha vietato la canzone “Glory to Hong Kong”, diventata l’inno non ufficiale delle estese proteste per la democrazia del 2019, represse dal governo cinese. La sentenza di mercoledì rende “Glory to Hong Kong” la prima canzone vietata a Hong Kong da quando l’ex colonia britannica è diventata regione amministrativa della Cina, nel 1997. Fino al 2020, anno di una contestata e repressiva legge cinese sulla sicurezza nazionale, Hong Kong aveva sempre goduto di un certo margine di autonomia, che dopo l’approvazione di quella legge si è andato via via riducendo, con sempre più processi e condanne nei confronti di attivisti e politici a favore della democrazia.\n\nLa sentenza di mercoledì impedisce la trasmissione e l’esecuzione della canzone. Lo scorso giugno il governo di Hong Kong aveva già chiesto alle autorità giudiziarie locali di vietare ogni forma di distribuzione e circolazione della canzone, compresa la sola melodia e qualsiasi adattamento, definendola un inno alla «secessione» dalla Cina e un «grave danno nazionale». Un mese dopo la Corte Suprema di Hong Kong aveva respinto la richiesta, sostenendo che il divieto potesse minare la libertà di espressione. Il governo aveva presentato un appello, accolto con la sentenza di mercoledì.\n\nTag:\nCINA\n-\nGLORY TO HONG KONG\n-\nHONG KONG\nCONSIGLIATI\nIl cantante più famoso che probabilmente non

Stati Uniti hanno rimpatriato 23 persone provenienti da paesi occidentali che vivevano nei campi di detenzione in Siria per chi ha o aveva legami con lo Stato Islamico (ISIS) o altri gruppi jihadisti. Undici sono statunitensi, uno è fratello di uno statunitense (ma senza cittadinanza), sei canadesi, quattro olandesi e uno finlandese: fra loro ci sono otto bambini.\n\nDa ormai cinque anni, dopo la fine della guerra con lo Stato Islamico, migliaia di persone che avevano avuto legami con l’ISIS vivono in campi di detenzione in Siria, controllati dalle Forze Democratiche Curde, l’esercito curdo alleato degli Stati Uniti nella guerra allo Stato Islamico. Sono perlopiù donne e bambini (i minori sarebbero circa 29mila), alcuni nati proprio nei campi, altri orfani. La maggioranza è costituita da persone di nazionalità irachena o siriana, ma 9mila sono cittadini di altri 60 paesi, uomini e donne che avevano lasciato l’Europa o i paesi occidentali per unirsi allo Stato Islamico, e i loro figli. La gran parte dei paesi europei si è mostrata molto riluttante a rimpatriare queste persone, per timore che costituiscano un problema per la sicurezza.\n\nIl campo di al-Hol (AP Photo/Baderkhan Ahmad, File)\n\nSecondo il segretario di Stato americano Antony Blinken «l’unica soluzione definitiva alla crisi umanitaria e di sicurezza costituita dai campi di detenzione nel nord est della Siria è che i paesi rimpatrino, riabilitino e reintegrino i propri cittadini, dopo averli perseguiti per i loro eventuali crimini». Gli Stati Uniti non hanno comunicato le identità delle persone rimpatriate, ma i media statunitensi, fra cui il New York Times, hanno ricostruito che si tratta di una donna, Brandy Salman, sposata a un uomo turco, e dei suoi nove figli. Gli altri due rimpatriati sono i figli di un ex combattente dell’ISIS che sta scontando una pena detentiva negli Stati Uniti, ma che ha collaborato fornendo informazioni sullo Stato Islamico.\n\nTag:\nISIS\n-\nSIRIA\n-\nSTATI UNITI\n-\nSTATO ISLAMICO\nCONSIGLIATI\nIl cantante più famoso che probabilmente non conoscete\nOgni maledetto mercoledì, se sei il Papa, succede

È l’incredibile paragone avanzato da Tonia Mastrobuoni, corrispondente da Berlino per il quotidiano Repubblica. Nel salotto di Omnibus, su La7, lunedì mattina si stava parlando di premier e legittimazione popolare: il giornalista di Libero Francesco Specchia aveva sottolineato come Meloni goda di un grande consenso popolare, certificato anche dalle elezioni politiche.\n\nQuand’ecco che la Mastrobuoni pronuncia la sua frase choc: «Anche Hitler è stato votato con il 33%!». E mentre il suo sconcertato interlocutore cercava di ragionare sull’assurdità del parallelo, la Mastrobuoni ribadiva il concetto: «Sì, Hitler ha preso il 33%». A quel punto Specchia le ha chiesto se davvero credesse che la Meloni la giornalista ribadiva implicitamente il paragone, sostenendo che il dittatore nazista non avrebbe dato un gran prova di democrazia, o almeno questo è ciò che mi è sembrato di comprendere nel suo concitato eloquio.\n\n \n\n\"Inquietudine.

Sulla fronte di Meloni è comparsa anche una “zeta”, che rimanda al simbolo presente sui carri armati delle forze russe coinvolte nell’invasione dell\n’Ucraina\n.\n\n \n\n\"Meloni sulla jeep?

Il contesto è quello dello scontro in atto tra il direttore del TgLa7 e Lilli Gruber, mattatrice di Otto e Mezzo, insomma lo scontro tra due dei volti di punta de La7.\n\nAd aprire le danze era stata Lilli, che nella puntata in onda il 6 maggio si era lamentata con toni puntuti dello sforamento di Mentana (la trasmissione della Gruber, infatti, era iniziata alle 20.46). \"L'incontinenza è una brutta cosa. Scusateci di questo ritardo\", questa la frase incriminata. Dunque, il giorno successivo, la durissima replica di Mitraglietta: un post in cui mostra la curva degli ascolti e rivendica come il suo tiggì faccia da traino per Otto e Mezzo. Dunque il direttore ha parlato di \"giudizio gravemente sprezzante\" e ha ricordato come \"nessuno tra i vertici ha sentito il bisogno di prendere le distanze\". E ancora: \"A questo punto le distanze, come è doveroso, le prendo io dai maleducati e dagli ignavi\". Parole pesantissime, che però non hanno sortito effetti. Tanto che nel TgLa7 del giorno successivo, Mentana, ha de facto minacciato le dimissioni: \"L'azienda esca dal mutismo dopo le offese della collega o ne trarrò le conseguenze\". Parole piuttosto chiare, che non lasciano troppi margini all'ambiguità.\n\n \n\n\"Gli insulti non possono passare sotto silenzio\". Caso-Mentana, Gaia Tortora si schiera\n\nBene, dopo le lunghe e doverose premesse, dopo aver ricostruito il contesto, arriviamo all'intervento dell'editore. Per usare le parole di Mentana, \"è uscita dal mutismo\". Lo ha fatto con una nota firmata dall'editore, ossia Urbano Cairo, nota che recita: \"La7 sta conseguendo ottimi risultati grazie al contributo di tutti e ad un prezioso lavoro di squadra. Per questo è fondamentale che non venga mai a mancare il rispetto reciproco. Così come è fondamentale che non manchi il rispetto verso un'Azienda che ha nei suoi valori fondanti la libertà di espressione e l'autonomia responsabile dei suoi conduttori e giornalisti\". \n\n \n\n\"Se non succede nulla, ne trarrò le conclusioni\": Mentana e lo scontro con la Gruber, minaccia l'addio?\n\nE ancora, riprende la nota: \"Un'Azienda che ha saputo negli anni mantenere e ampliare il livello di occupazione, risanarsi economicamente, e diventare un punto di riferimento di eccellenza nel panorama informativo e culturale italiano. Per questo va preservata e tutelata sempre da parte di tutti noi, che ci lavoriamo quotidianamente con passione e orgoglio\", conclude Urbano Cairo.

Muscles Up iPad Pro With M4 Silicon and Tandem OLED Display","description":"In addition to the iPad Pro models with its next-generation M4 silicon, Apple introduced two new iPad Airs, an 11-inch and, for the first time, a 13-inch model, both with M2 silicon under the hood.","article_body":"Apple beefed up its iPad product line Tuesday by upgrading the silicon in its Air models and introducing a new processor, the M4, into its Pro editions, which also got a display boost to OLED.\n\n“The iPad Pro with the M4 and outdoor viewable OLED screen is arguably the best tablet created so far,” Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst with Enderle Group, an advisory services firm in Bend, Ore., told TechNewsWorld.\n\n“The dual-layer OLED screens are the best screens ever used on a tablet and make the creative process much more realistic,” added Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, a technology advisory firm in San Jose, Calif.\n\nThe new 11-inch and 13-inch Pro models announced at an online, prerecorded event have displays made of two OLED panels for exceptional brightness. According to Apple, the Ultra Retina XDR display supports 1,000 nits of full-screen brightness for SDR and HDR content and 1,600 nits of HDR peak brightness.\n\nThe new iPad Pro comes in two sizes, 11-inch and 13-inch, and features the thinnest design Apple has ever produced. (Image Credit: Apple)\n\nA nano-texture glass option is also offered for the display. Nano-texture glass is engineered to scatter ambient light and reduce glare.\n\nBoth the tandem OLED and etched glass overlay are unique, noted Jim McGregor, founder and principal analyst at Tirias Research, a high-tech research and advisory firm, in Phoenix. “I have not seen this dual-layer OLED display solution before,” he told TechNewsWorld. “The etched glass overlay is also unique.”\n\n“The display is stunning,” Enderle said. “The only thing I wonder about is longevity. OLED is beautiful but not very robust, and they are pushing a lot of power through it. Longevity of the display could become an issue long term.”\n\n“As a photographer, I am excited to see how my images will look on it,” added Anshel Sag, a senior analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, a technology analyst and advisory firm based in Austin, Texas.\n\n“However, I am a little surprised they didn’t try to beef up the camera’s capabilities to really show off the display,” he told TechNewsWorld.\n\nEnter M4 Silicon\n\nIn an unusual move, Apple introduced its next-generation M4 silicon into the new iPad Pro models. “Usually, next-gen chips are introduced on the Mac first,” Bajarin told TechNewsWorld. “Apple did this to emphasize their belief that the iPad is very much a PC as Jobs envisioned when he launched it 14 years ago, making it a powerful creative tool that mirrors the functionality mostly done on a PC.”\n\nThe chip is built on second-generation three-nanometer technology, which is more power-efficient than its predecessors. Apple said the M4 can deliver the same performance as the M2 chip in the previous iPad Pro models, using half the power.\n\nAccording to Apple, the M4 delivers 50% faster CPU performance than the company’s M2 silicon and four times better overall performance than M2.\n\n“A new version of Apple silicon making its debut in an iPad is a shift from where we’ve historically seen it introduced. It is consistent, though, with Apple positioning iPad as a full-featured main computer option,” said Ross Rubin, the principal analyst with Reticle Research, a consumer technology advisory firm in New York City.\n\nRendering performance in apps like Octane sees a substantial upgrade with the M4 chip, now up to four times faster than previous iPad Pro models equipped with the M2. (Image Credit: Apple)\n\n“That they put their most advanced, highest-performance chip in the iPad lends credibility to their statements that they see the iPad as the future of the computer,” he told TechNewsWorld.\n\n“They also released their professional apps on the platform,” he continued. “In some ways, that is a stronger endorsement of the iPad as a creative powerhouse. It also sends a strong signal to third-party developers, such as Adobe, that this an appropriate platform for those kinds of applications.”\n\n“That’s been challenging for Apple in the past because when they’ve talked about high performance, they’ve shown games on the iPhone and iPad,” he explained. “That can be a great visual showcase, but for a product that can cost north of $1,000 and has a professional label affixed to it, you need to show that the productivity tools and capabilities are there.”\n\nMikako Kitagawa, a director and analyst with Gartner, a research and advisory company based in Stamford, Conn., agreed. “I see Apple trying to sharpen up the position of iPad as the best tablet for the creative professionals,” she told TechNewsWorld.\n\nPlay To Boost Sales\n\nTirias’ McGregor reasoned that Apple will probably have different versions of the M4 for the various products in its portfolio, but introducing the chip in the iPad Pro is a significant move.\n\n“Coming out with this version specifically for the iPad Pro first makes a strong statement that Apple views the iPad as a critical product for the market, not an accessory product,” he said. “For many consumers, the iPad has become their primary computing platform.”\n\nJitesh Ubrani, a research manager at IDC, a global market research company, concurred that introducing the M4 on the iPad Pro indicates Apple is taking the form factor seriously but still sees it as an add-on.\n\n“It’s not a MacBook replacement by any means. Rather, it’s a complementary device,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Beyond that, I think the timing around the release of the M4 also puts pressure on Qualcomm as their comparisons with the M3 are immediately outdated.”\n\nApple’s motivation behind introducing the M4 in the iPad line may also be a reaction to sales numbers. “In the first six months of Apple’s fiscal 2024, which ends in September, iPad sales dropped more than 20% compared to the previous year, a worrying trend that Apple will be looking to reverse with today’s new models,” Felix Richter wrote for Statista on Tuesday.\n\nApple’s iPad revenue and its share of the company’s total revenue\n\nWill Kerwin, a technology equity analyst with Morningstar Research Services in Chicago, agreed. “We believe this shows a recognition by the company that the iPad has been underperforming and warrants a priority in driving a return to growth,” he told TechNewsWorld.\n\nPencils and Palettes\n\nIn addition to the Pro models, Apple introduced two new iPad Airs, an 11-inch and, for the first time, a 13-inch model, both with M2 silicon under the hood. The starting prices for the iPad Air models are $599 for the 11-inch and $799 for the 13-inch. The 11-inch iPad Pro starts at $999, while the 13-inch model will sell starting at $1,299. The Air and Pro models will be available for purchase on May 15.\n\nTwo upgraded accessories were also announced at the Apple event: a new “magic” keyboard and a new pencil. Apple has added function keys to the keyboard, an aluminum palm rest, and a larger trackpad with haptic feedback.\n\nThe new Apple pencil has a sensor that allows a new tool palette to appear on an iPad’s screen by squeezing the barrel of the stylus. A gyroscope allows the pencil to be used more precisely.\n\nApple Pencil Pro brings support for Find My for the first time to Apple Pencil, helping users locate Pencil Pro if misplaced. It pairs, charges, and is stored on the side of the iPad Pro with a new magnetic interface. (Image Credit: Apple)\n\n“The pencil continues to show how Apple innovates,” observed Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at SmartTech Research in San Jose, Calif.\n\n“You can use that stylus across their portfolio of iPads using the squeeze capability,” he told TechNewsWorld. “That’s a significant time-saver. I do a little digital editing on the iPad, and the ability to remove masks or edit things on the screen with precision is a big deal.”\n\n“The Apple Pencil Pro is a big step forward in stylus capability for managing images and video content,” he said.\n\n“The hovering capabilities, the ability to change the orientation of tools by squeezing the pencil before the stylus touches the surface

La proposta avanzata da Banca d’Italia di fermare il Superbonus prima della scadenza \"sarebbe stata gradita nel 2023, nel 2022 o nel 2021. Invece arriva nel 2024, quando il governo sta esattamente procedendo a fare questo\", ha affermato il ministro dell’Economia, Giancarlo Giorgetti, a margine dei lavori in Senato sul decreto superbonus, rispondendo ad una domanda dei cronisti sull’ipotesi contenuta in una memoria depositata da Palazzo Koch. Poi Giorgetti ha aggiunto: \"Il governo presenterà il suo emendamento, e se ne assume la responsabilità. Come avvenuto in passato, gli emendamenti parlamentari di ampliamento delle deroghe non saranno presi in considerazione\".\n\nE a questo punto il ministro del Tesoro ha analizzato cosa è successo finora: \"Grazie agli antichi romani, che hanno insegnato al mondo il diritto, esistono i diritti acquisiti: chi ha cominciato il lavoro nel 2021 ha diritto di finirlo nel 2023 e presentare le fatture, cosa abbastanza banale che dovrebbe essere di facile intelligibilità per chiunque. Quando noi siamo intervenuti a porre una diga a questa cosa, la valanga era già partita\". E ancora: \"Com’è successo in Vajont, una volta arrivata giù la valanga ha prodotto disastri. Quando noi siamo arrivati al governo siamo stati avvisati e abbiamo fatto il possibile, ma purtroppo era già partita\".\n\n \n\nPerfino Monti dà ragione a Giorgia: il superbonus è stato una truffa colossale\n\n \n\nInfine commenta anche le trattative tra Ita e Lufthansa: \"Sono fiducioso, altrimenti non farei questo mestiere. Abbiamo fatto tutto quello che si poteva fare. Credo che il 99,9% degli italiani pensi questa sia una buona operazione, risolve definitivamente una situazione incresciosa pluriennale sulla compagnia aerea nazionale.

Lo pensa il ministro dei Trasporti e vicepremier Matteo Salvini che ha commentato così le uscite del capo dell’Eliseo e dell’ex premier sull’ipotesi di invio di truppe in Ucraina. “Mi turba che dopo Macron, anche Monti oggi parli dell’invio di soldati italiani a combattere in Ucraina – dice Salvini parlando a Rho Fiera, a Milano – Questi vanno curati: chi la pensa così e lo dice come se fosse una cosa normale, vale per Macron e per Monti, sono pericolosi”. “Parlare di soldati italiani che potranno andare a combattere e morire in Ucraina lo ritengo una cosa gravissima“, ha continuato Salvini. “Ieri – ha detto ancora il leader leghista – Putin ha invitato al dialogo e io spero che il 2024 sia l’anno della pace. Se Monti e Macron hanno tanta voglia di combattere, vadano in Ucraina. Io sono disponibile a ricostruire porti, ferrovie, strade, scuole e ospedali. Quando qualche italiano parla facilmente di guerra e soldati che combattono e muoiono fuori dai confini, secondo me c’è dietro un problema“. A prescindere dal cosa, il come sembra mettere in imbarazzo il resto della maggioranza. Il capogruppo di Fratelli d’Italia alla Camera Tommaso Foti prova a rimetterla a posto così: “E’ legittimo che ogni capo di Stato abbia le sue opinioni su eventuali interventi che, però, ovviamente possono e devono impegnare il proprio paese. Dopodiché il resto non mi permetto di commentarlo perché non ne vedo la necessità”.\n\nCos’aveva detto Monti in un’intervista a Radio24? “Io credo che a un certo punto potrà essere necessario” mandare truppe di terra in Ucraina. Ma, “io credo” anche “che, più che mandare uomini a combattere là, come dice Macron, serva intensificare ulteriormente il sostegno finanziario e con armamenti“. “Se pensiamo che la Russia possa davvero andare anche più ad occidente dell’Ucraina, se queste sono le sue intenzioni, è chiaro che va fermata”, ha aggiunto l’ex premier.\n\nLEGGI ANCHE\nDestre e dem: tutti pacifinti con vista urne\n\nCome noto la Lega, che ha sempre votato tutti i provvedimenti sugli aiuti militari, ha spesso posto la questione di una ripresa e un rafforzamento dei canali diplomatici: dal punto di vista comunicativo il Carroccio ha ulteriormente spinto su questo tasto nelle ultime settimane con l’inizio della campagna elettorale. A questo proposito la Lega ha invitato l’ambasciatore di Francia in Italia Martin Briens alla Camera per essere audito. A fare la convocazione è stato il presidente della commissione Politiche Ue, il leghista Alessandro Giglio Vigna: “L’invio diretto di truppe Ue nel conflitto in Ucraina sarebbe una follia, la Lega è completamente contro questa ipotesi” ribadisce Vigna. Il presidente di commissione precisa peraltro che “il Parlamento non ha potere di convoca è un invito ma ritengo che l’ambasciatore francese debba chiarire, precisare ed eventualmente smorzare le parole” di Macron.\n\nQuanto alla linea del governo, il centrosinistra unito (cioè Pd, M5s e Verdi-Sinistra) hanno chiesto in Aula all’esecutivo di riferire “sulla natura delle armi inviate in Ucraina”. “Presidente – ha detto il capogruppo dei 5 Stelle Francesco Silvestri – mi chiedo se vi sembra normale che il nostro Paese debba venire a conoscenza che questo governo sta mandando missili a lunga gittata nel conflitto ucraino-russo non dal ministro italiano ma quello britannico.

Al centro della discussione c'era la mozione di sfiducia nel consiglio regionale. A diffondere i fermo immagine del presidente di Regione è stata l’emittente locale Telesveva.\n\nLa mozione di sfiducia nei suoi confronti era stata presentata due settimane fa dall’opposizione di centrodestra dopo le vicende giudiziarie che hanno travolto molti dei suoi fedelissimi. In ogni caso, la discussione in consiglio regionale, giochi sul cellulare a parte, è stata molto accesa. A difendere Emiliano è stato Saverio Tammacco, capogruppo di Per la Puglia, secondo cui la mozione non avrebbe ottenuto i voti necessari per passare. A suo dire, inoltre, sarebbe infondata l'accusa di trasformismo rivolta la governatore, il cui lavoro sarebbe sempre stato fatto per il bene dei cittadini. \n\n \n\n \n\n\"Sarà impegnato con la sorella del boss\". Gasparri attacca Emiliano, scoppia un altro caso in Puglia\n\n \n\n\"Se trasformismo vuol dire andare laddove si può lavorare per il bene dei cittadini, allora chiamatemi pure trasformista,\" ha dichiarato Tammacco, secondo cui l'opposizione non avrebbe fatto invece proposte costruttive. Poi ha sottolineato come il cambiamento in Puglia sotto la guida di Emiliano sia evidente per via dell'ottimo lavoro portato avanti dall'amministrazione. Alla fine, la mozione di sfiducia è stata respinta con 31 voti contrari e 18 favorevoli. Ad opporsi anche i gruppi del M5s e di Azione. \n\nNel corso della discussione in consiglio regionale, il dibattito ha toccato anche temi relativi alla sanità. Con qualcuno che avrebbe addirittura suggerito che la sessione avrebbe potuto concentrarsi su questo argomento piuttosto che su una \"farsa\" di mozione di sfiducia. Emiliano, intanto, è atteso alla commissione Antimafia il 10 maggio.

Il video e le immagini del premier a bordo di una jeep durante una parata militare hanno indignato la sinistra. Allora mettiamo in chiaro subito una cosa: diversi premier di sinistra hanno nel loro album fotografico (basti pensare a Letta con l'elmetto) foto con le forze armate. Il fatto che un premier partecipi alle parate o agli eventi che riguardano l'esercito è del tutto normale nei protocolli e in quel preciso istante lo Stato rappresentato dal presidente del Consiglio omaggia le divise che assicurano ai cittadini la sicurezza all'interno del territorio nazionale (e non solo). Ma se a farlo è Meloni, apriti cielo.\n\nE così la Piccolotti a Di Martedì tuona contro Meloni : \"Mi ricorda tante altre immagini...\". E il riferimento nemmeno tanto velato è a dittature del passato. Un accostamento surreale che ha stupito anche i presenti in studio, tra questi Mauro Mazza.\n\n \n\n\"Informatevi prima di fomentare l'odio\". Meloni sulla jeep? Crosetto zittisce la sinistra con queste foto\n\n \n\nMa la Piccolotti non molla la presa e aggiunge: \"Mi ricorda tante altre immagini che annunciavano venti di guerra\". Del resto per quelle immagini Meloni è stata letteralmente processata nello studio di Floris con Giannini che ha puntato il dito (ancora una volta) contro il presidente del Consiglio: \"Mi inquieta quel video. Fa davvero impressione\". Un vero e proprio delirio che mette in luce un aspetto a poche settimane dal voto alle Europee: la sinistra è così disperata da attaccarsi anche a una foto di Meloni pur di racimolare qualche zerovirgola nei sondaggi. \n\n \n\nGiorgia Meloni sulla jeep militare?

Il divieto di rendere disponibili per la consultazione e il prestito libri che trattino di famiglie composte da due padri o due madri è stato proposto dal consigliere laburista (centrosinistra) Steve Christou, approvato a maggioranza (5 voti a 4, quattro consiglieri erano assenti) e giustificato dai promotori con la necessità di proteggere i bambini da «ogni forma di sessualizzazione».\n\nChristou, ex sindaco di Cumberland, ha detto di aver presentato la mozione dopo le molte proteste da esponenti della comunità, definita «molto religiosa e molto legata alla famiglia tradizionale» e ha portato come esempio di libri da «bandire» Same-Sex Parents di Holly Duhig, inizialmente pubblicato nel Regno Unito e presente nelle biblioteche della zona dal 2019: racconta l’esperienza di avere due madri o due padri dal punto di vista del bambino e ha una foto di due uomini con un bambino in copertina.\n\nL’attuale sindaca, Lisa Lake, ha votato contro la mozione e ha commentato con «sgomento e tristezza» l’esito della votazione. Sulla questione è intervenuto anche il governo statale del New South Wales: il ministro delle Arti John Graham ritiene che la decisione possa violare la legge Anti-discriminazioni e che per questo le biblioteche di Cumberland City potrebbero perdere i finanziamenti pubblici. Nel distretto di Cumberland City vivono circa 250mila persone, il consiglio comunale ha annunciato di aver cominciato il processo di analisi per definire quali libri «debbano essere rimossi».\n\nTag:\nAUSTRALIA\n-\nBIBLIOTECHE\n-\nFAMIGLIE OMOGENITORIALI\nCONSIGLIATI\nLe forme e gli oggetti che ci portiamo dietro nonostante il progresso\nGli stati con le capitali trabocchetto\nUn

trovati nella villa di Donald Trump è stato rimandato a tempo indeterminato\nCondividi\nAggiungi ai preferiti\n(Win McNamee/Pool Photo via AP)\n\nLa giudice statunitense Aileen Cannon ha deciso di rimandare a tempo indeterminato l’inizio del processo contro l’ex presidente degli Stati Uniti Donald Trump, accusato di aver conservato alcuni documenti governativi riservati nella propria villa di Mar-a-Lago, in Florida. Il processo è uno dei quattro, penali, in cui Trump è coinvolto: la prima udienza era stata inizialmente fissata per il 20 maggio, ma da tempo si pensava che sarebbe stata posticipata, dati i molti ritardi che si erano accumulati negli ultimi mesi nel risolvere questioni legali preliminari in sospeso.\n\nLa giudice Cannon non ha fissato una nuova data, ed è plausibile che a questo punto il processo venga posticipato in prossimità delle elezioni presidenziali del 5 novembre o dopo. Trump è candidato alle primarie del Partito Repubblicano, e per ora ha vinto quasi ovunque: ha già ottenuto abbastanza delegati per assicurarsi la nomina come candidato del partito alle presidenziali.\n\nTag:\nDONALD TRUMP\n-\nSTATI UNITI\nCONSIGLIATI\n«Le macchine senza autista non stanno andando da nessuna parte»\nPerché il buddhismo ha ragione\nStoria e tecnica del sedere

ecco dove si possono installare i pannelli e dove no","description":"Stop alle installazioni selvagge a terra e via libera all’energia green nei terreni non produttivi come le cave e le miniere cessate","article_body":"Dopo un braccio di ferro nel governo tra il responsabile dell’Agricoltura Francesco Lollobrigida e quello dell’Ambiente Gilberto Pichetto Fratin, alla fine i tecnici ministeriali hanno individuato una soluzione che ha ottenuto il via libera di entrambe le parti: stop all’installazione di pannelli a terra nei terreni produttivi; via libera invece allo sviluppo delle rinnovabili in aree come cave o miniere cessate, ma anche nei terreni nella disponibilità del gruppo Fs o dei gestori aeroportuali, come pure quelle interne agli impianti industriali o agli stabilimenti produttivi, comprese quelle aree entro un perimetro di 500 metri dai predetti ambienti o stabilimenti. Semaforo verde, poi, per nuovi impianti green anche nelle aree adiacenti alla rete autostradale, entro i 300 metri e nei siti su cui già insistono impianti per rifacimento, modifica o revisione senza ulteriore occupazione di suolo. Queste soluzioni sono state previste dal decreto sulle emergenze per l’agricoltura approvato lunedì 6 maggio dal Consiglio dei ministri.\nSalvi i procedimenti già autorizzati\nCon la riformulazione del testo, cui hanno lavorato i tecnici, vengono salvaguardati i procedimenti già autorizzati, ma «servirà una procedura per valutare cosa includere e cosa no» ha chiarito al termine del Cdm Pichetto Fratin dopo averassicuato che con il decreto vengono salvaguardati anche gli investimenti previsti nel Pnrr, in particolare quelli legati alle comunità energetiche rinnovabili (Cer). Lo stop, si legge infatti nella bozza del decreto legge, «non si applica nel caso in cui gli impianti con moduli a terra siano oggetto di configurazioni di autoconsumo e Cer». Nulla toglie, ha assicurato poi l’esponente di Forza italia, «al fatto che il Pniec al 2030 rimanga lo stesso con un obiettivo di rinnovabili sul fronte solare di circa 38 gigawatt». Che, nei piani del Mase, dovrebbero arrivare dal fotovoltaico nelle aree agricole, con un’occupazione dello 0,35% della superficie agricola totale.\nIl testo iniziale\nLa bozza iniziale del provvedimento prevedeva di fatto un divieto per ogni forma di pannello su terreni coltivati, uno stop chiesto da tempo da Coldiretti.

diretto con i professionisti - ItaliaOggi.it","description":"Il ministro della giustizia Nordio agli Stati generali del Cndcec lancia la cabina di regia delle&nbsp;professioni economico-giuridiche, per un confronto costante con commercialisti, avvocati e notai","article_body":"    \n\n\n\n\n00:00\n/\n00:00\nUn momento degli Stati generali dei commercialisti\n\nNasce la cabina di regia delle professioni economico-giuridiche sotto l’«egida» del ministro della Giustizia Carlo Nordio, luogo nel quale il titolare del dicastero potrà confrontarsi (in un clima di «collaborazione permanente») con i vertici dei notai, dei commercialisti e degli avvocati che rappresentano circa 365.000 iscritti agli ordini, coinvolti in un dialogo «su tutti i temi riguardanti il loro settore» che il governo «si troverà ad affrontare».\n\nE, intanto, si avvicina il «traguardo storico» dell’approvazione della proposta di legge di FdI 1276 (finora licenziata dalla commissione Giustizia della Camera) delle norme sulla responsabilità dei componenti dei collegi sindacali, disciplinata, a oggi, dall’articolo 2407 del codice civile.\n\nAgli Stati generali dei commercialisti, a Roma, il presidente Elbano de Nuccio ha snocciolato dal palco altri numeri sugli esponenti della categoria (dopo quelli apparsi ieri su ItaliaOggi) che, sfondato il «tetto» delle 120.400 unità, esercitano l’attività nei «69.210 studi dislocati su tutto il territorio nazionale», strutture che danno lavoro a «circa 297.000 persone».\n\nE non è tutto, giacché, ha puntualizzato al centro congressi «La Nuvola» dinanzi a 2.000 colleghi, «i dati relativi agli invii telematici sul canale Entratel dell’Agenzia delle Entrate attestano che, su circa 5,8 milioni di soggetti tra lavoratori autonomi e imprese individuali, società di persone e associazioni, società di capitali ed enti non commerciali, sono circa 4,35 milioni, pari al 75% del totale, quelli che adempiono ai propri obblighi fiscali attraverso di noi».\n\nPerciò, è il «tasto» su cui ha «battuto» la guida dei commercialisti, «se si considera il gettito fiscale che proviene anche soltanto dalle principali imposte pagate dalle imprese e dai professionisti (Iva, Irpef, Ires e Irap), pari a circa 281 miliardi, è dunque possibile stimare in circa 211 miliardi quello che affluisce alle casse dello Stato tramite l’attività di consulenza e assistenza fiscale che prestiamo».\n\nUna delle sfide, d’ora in avanti, sarà portare avanti il confronto con le Istituzioni, «affinché ragioni e competenze delle professioni siano ascoltate non più solo a valle della elaborazione normativa, ma già a monte»: un’altra «chance» la fornirà la cabina di regia annunciata da Nordio (la data della prima convocazione ancora non c’è, ma si riunirà «a brevissimo», ha confidato de Nuccio a ItaliaOggi), salutata con entusiasmo dai numeri uno dei Consigli nazionali del Notariato e forense Giulio Biino (un’iniziativa «epocale», l’ha definita) e Francesco Greco che, alla presenza del ministro all’assise capitolina, ha espresso la «preoccupazione» degli avvocati per il «tentativo» dell’Anac (Autorità anticorruzione) di limitare il perimetro della legge sull’equo compenso (49/2023) attraverso «una distorta interpretazione delle norme sugli appalti pubblici».\n\nNon appare lontano, poi, il varo dell’Aula di Montecitorio della proposta di legge sulla «perimetrazione, non limitazione, della responsabilità dei componenti del collegio sindacale», ha scandito il vertice dei commercialisti, ringraziando alcuni firmatari del testo presenti agli Stati generali, i deputati di FdI Marta Schifone, Andrea de Bertoldi e Mariangela Matera. A dire la sua, infine, il sottosegretario alle Imprese e made in Italy Massimo Bitonci: «Sono un vostro collega», ha esordito, «ho la delega alle professioni non ordinistiche ma, voglio dirlo, non basta l’iscrizione alla camera di commercio per svolgere determinate funzioni», aggiungendo che «la legge 4 del 2013 non dà delle competenze», bensì «regolamenta un settore», quello delle professioni associative.\n\nRiproduzione riservata\n\n\n\n\n\nNews correlate\nMantovano al G7 dell'avvocatura: a breve disegno di legge sull'intelligenza artificiale\n\nIl sottosegretario alla presidenza del consiglio dei ministri: gli avvocati devono essere in prima linea per vigilare che l’IA...\n\nGiustizia, flop dei 13 processi intentati contro Carmelo Patti (Valtur)\n\nLa corte d’appello di Palermo ha annullato il provvedimento di confisca dei beni dell’ex patron di Valtur, morto nel...\n\nResponsabilità del collegio sindacale, commercialisti: vicini a traguardo storico\n\nLa Commissione giustizia della Camera ha dato il via libera alla proposta di legge che punta a modificare l'articolo 2407 del...\n\nLa pace edilizia si farà.

Davis: emesso francobollo per vittoria Italia 2023 - Tennis - Speciale Internazionali - Ansa.it","description":"Celebrato lo storico successo degli azzurri a Malaga (ANSA)","article_body":"Con calma, l'Italia celebra con un francobollo la vittoria italiana in Coppa Davis del 2023, avvenuta a Malaga nel novembre scorso.\n\nIl francobollo (valido per la posta prioritaria diretta in Europa, pari a 3,60€) mostra, in grafica stilizzata su un fondino bianco, la squadra italiana maschile di tennis nell'atto di alzare il trofeo della Coppa Davis, la massima competizione mondiale a squadre nazionali.\n\nMa c'è anche un'edizione in \"foglietto\" che invece della grafica stilizzata mostra una foto con i volti dei protagonisti della vittoria: Lorenzo Musetti, Matteo Arnaldi, il capitano Filippo Volandri, Jannik Sinner, Simone Bolelli e Lorenzo Sonego.\n\n Il bollettino illustrativo che accompagna l'emissione è firmato da Angelo Binaghi, presidente della Federazione italiana tennis e padel: \"C'è voluto quasi mezzo secolo per bissare la vittoria in Coppa Davis del 1976 in Cile\". La squadra ha riportato in Italia \"quello che probabilmente è il trofeo più iconico del mondo dello sport. Non solo perché parliamo della competizione a squadre più antica ma perché - conclude Binaghi - giocare in Davis è il sogno di milioni di ragazzini nel mondo che si avvicinano a questa meravigliosa

McDonagh, 39, of Sandfields, Port Talbot, tried to shield their faces as they arrived at Swansea Magistrates' Court. \n\nMr McDonagh, dressed in a salmon-coloured polo shirt and light grey jacket, put his hand over his face with Mrs McDonagh walking in front with the hood of her light brown trench coat pulled over her head. \n\nThe serial dine and dashers today admitted five counts of fraud after skipping £1,168.10 worth of restaurant bills. \n\nThey also admitted shoplifting a total of £1,017.60 from Tommy Hilfiger, Sainsbury and Tesco. \n\n Mrs McDonagh also admitted a further offence of obstructing a police officer.\n\nThe couple, who have three children under the age of 16, will be sentenced later this month at Swansea Crown Court. They were both given bail.\n\n+\n4\nView gallery\n\nBernard McDonagh, 41, and Ann McDonagh, 39, tried to shield their faces as they arrived at Swansea Magistrates' Court accused of being suspected 'dine-and-dashers' who were caught on CCTV leaving restaurants without paying\n\n+\n4\nView gallery\n\nA family-of-eight allegedly racked up an unpaid £329 bill when they sat at the Bella Ciao Italian restaurant in Swansea\n\n+\n4\nView gallery\n\nMr McDonagh, dressed in a salmon-coloured polo shirt and a light grey jacket, put his hand over his face\n\n+\n4\nView gallery\n\nMrs McDonagh walked ahead with the hood of her light brown trench coat pulled over her head\n\nIt comes after MailOnline uncovered the 'dine and dash' playbook being deployed by the brazen couple in each of the outlets they hit in the past year. \n\nStaff at the Bella Ciao Italian restaurant in Swansea say they were the latest victims of this heist when the couple sat with a group of eight in their restaurant and left without paying the £329 bill.\n\nCCTV footage from the restaurant showed Mrs McDonagh attempting to pay the bill with a savings account card, which was declined twice.\n\nShe told staff her son would wait inside while she went to get her 'other card', but she did not return and moments later the boy had also vanished from the premises.\n\nThe footage went viral, with more than 12 million people viewing the post.\n\nThe family-owned restaurant learned that there was no way to contact the diners as the number they used to take the booking was 'fake'.\n\nA similar trick was used by the couple at the River House last year, when they ran up a hefty bill whilst sitting on a table of five and 'promised' to get cash from the local cash point after their card got declined.\n\nBut the diners never returned, leading the restaurant owners to call the police.\n\nAfter hearing the Bella Ciao story, the La Casona restaurant in Skewen, Neath, took to social media to share a similar story about the couple, who sat down to eat as a group of six on February 23.\n\nAccording to the restaurant, four of the group left the building after finishing their meal, which cost nearly £300, leaving the mother to stay with a 'young boy' to pay.\n\nThe business posted a CCTV image of the mother, who told staff she would get another card from her car after the one she used was declined.\n\nThe

Le Europee si avvicinano ma a quanto pare, sondaggi alla mano, il grande scatto in avanti del Pd non c'è stato. Di fatto si balla ancora su quel 19-20 per cento che rappresenta la soglia minima per evitare il tracollo dem e la perdita della poltrona da parte della segretaria.\n\nCosì per il 2 Giugno la segretaria dem ha annunciato l'ennesima manifestazione contro il governo e questa volta nel mirino c'è il premierato: \"Vi chiedo di mobilitarci in modo forte: il due giugno faremo una manifestazione a Roma sulla Costituzione e l’Europa federale contro il premierato e l’autonomia differenziata\".\n\n \n\n\"Si scrive Schlein, si legge Cgil\": Renzi smaschera la leader, \"il Pd non esiste più\"\n\n \n\nLa Schlein mette nel gran calderone anche l'Autonomia e dà vita alla solita manifestazione omnibus che alla fine non produce un chiaro percorso programmatico da opporre a quello dell'esecutivo. La sensazione è che la numero uno dei dem vada a rimorchio del governo. E nell'annunciare la sua scelta non poteva mancare l'attacco a Meloni sfruttando le critiche sul premierato: \"Questa assemblea straordinaria risponde a una accelerazione che stiamo vedendo e che vi chiedo di fermare. Una accelerazione dettata da ragioni elettoralisriche. Usiamo i nostri corpi e le nostre voci per fare muro rispetto a questo tentativo. Cercano di avanzare sul pericoloso terreno del premierato e della autonomia differenziata per avere qualcosa da sbandierare in campagna elettorale. È pericoloso perché si parla delle regole che tengono in piedi le regole costituzionali. Le cittadine e i cittadini devono ambire a fare cambiare idea e a correggere le scelte dell’esecutivo.

Il governatore della Liguria Giovanni Toti, posto ieri mattina agli arresti domiciliari nell’ambito di un’inchiesta della procura di Genova, si dichiara sereno. «Siamo tranquillissimi», ha detto entrando nella caserma della Guardia di Finanza, che ormai da quattro anni indagava sul presidente della Regione per presunti favori a imprenditori in cambio del finanziamento al suo partito.

flight, operated by American postal service FedEx, took off from Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport early this morning and was headed for Istanbul when the pilot realised the landing gear was malfunctioning. \n\nShocking footage showed the moment the plane attempted an emergency landing, smashing down into the runway and scraping its nose along the concrete.\n\nSparks flew from the plane's tattered fuselage as it crunched along the tarmac with smoke billowing from behind. \n\nThe crash will only compound woes for Boeing which is already facing intense scrutiny amid a string of mishaps and controversy over safety concerns - not to mention the deaths of two whistleblowers just two months apart. \n\n+\n14\nView gallery\n\nShocking footage showed the moment the plane attempted an

transport ministry having dispatched emergency teams as soon as it learned that the pilot's landing gear was not working. \n\nThe first responders flocked to surround the plane as it ground to a halt and immediately doused it with firefighting foam to prevent any potential fire from sparking. \n\nNo one was injured in today's incident and the crew safely evacuated the aircraft, said Abdulkadir Uraloglu, Turkey's transportation and infrastructure minister.\n\nThe runway where the plane landed was closed off while the aircraft was being removed, he said.\n\n'IGA Istanbul Airport Rescue and ARFF continues its efforts to move the aircraft to a safe area and open the runway to flight traffic. Flight traffic and operations continue smoothly on all other runways, including the spare runways,' a statement read.  \n\nBoeing is already under the microscope amid mounting controversy over safety problems, suspected quality control issues and the deaths of whistleblowers.\n\nThe US' Federal Aviation Administration said Monday it has opened an investigation into the company after workers at a South Carolina plant falsified inspection records on certain 787 planes. \n\nIn an email to Boeing's South Carolina employees on April 29, Scott Stocker, who leads the 787 program, said a worker observed an 'irregularity' in a required test of the wing-to-body join and reported it to his manager.\n\n'After receiving the report, we quickly reviewed the matter and learned that several people had been violating Company policies by not performing a required test, but recording the work as having been completed,' Stocker wrote.\n\nNo planes have been taken out of service, but having to perform the test out of order on planes will slow the delivery of jets still being built at the final assembly plant in North Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nBoeing must also create a plan to address planes that are already flying, the FAA said.\n\n'The FAA is investigating whether Boeing completed the inspections and whether company employees may have falsified aircraft records,' a statement read.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Murat Herdem (@herdem_aviation)\n\n+\n14\nView gallery\n\nDozens of grounded Boeing 737 MAX aircraft are seen parked in an aerial photo at Boeing Field in Seattle, Washington, U.S. July 1, 2019.

They're raising concerns because people's lives are at stake.' \n\n+\n14\nView gallery\n\nJohn Barnett, 62, died in March  by suicide in the midst of a legal action against Boeing\n\n+\n14\nView gallery\n\nFormer quality auditor at Spirit AeroSystems, Joshua Dean died last week from an infection\n\n+\n14\nView gallery\n\nBoeing engineer Sam Salehpour testifies before the US Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Investigations \n\nBoeing whistleblower say he received DEATH THREATS raising concerns\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\n0:00\nPrevious\nPlay\nSkip\nMute\nCurrent Time\n0:00\n/\nDuration Time\n2:20\nFullscreen\nNeed Text\n\nWhile Knowles has declined to speculate about Barnett's apparent suicide, he said the Boeing whistleblower never showed any signs that he wanted to end his life.\n\nThe lawyer said: 'I knew John Barnett for seven years and never saw anything that would indicate he would take his own life... Then again, I've never dealt with someone who did [commit suicide[. So maybe you don't see the signs. I don't know.'\n\nDean previously said he was fired from his job as a quality auditor at Spirit AeroSystems for questioning standards at the supplier's plant in Wichita, Kansas, in October 2022. \n\nBoeing's share prices have tumbled by almost 10 percent to $173.86 over the past six months as more safety concerns have come to light. \n\nSpirit manufactured the door plug on the Boeing jet which shockingly blew out midair on an Alaska Airlines flight in January.\n\nDean died in hospital on Tuesday after a sudden illness, his family said on social media. He was fired from Spirit AeroSystems in April 2023.\n\nEarlier this year, Dean spoke with NPR about being fired. 'I think they were sending out a message to anybody else. If you are too loud, we will silence you,' he said.\n\nHis former employer, Spirit AeroSystems shared a statement expressing condolences to Dean's family.\n\n'Our thoughts are with Josh Dean's family, spokesperson Joe Buccino said. 'This sudden loss is stunning news here and for his loved ones.'\n\nIn January, Dean told The Wall Street Journal that he was fired because he pointed out that holes were wrongly drilled in a fuselage, something his employer denied.\n\n'It is known at Spirit that if you make too much noise and cause too much trouble, you will be moved. It doesn't mean you completely disregard stuff, but they don't want you to find everything and write it up,' he said.\n\nBoeing has long denied Dean, and other whistleblower claims that the company willfully ignored safety warnings.\n\nBarnett, meanwhile, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound - though his friends contested this, saying that he told them before 'if anything happens to me, it's

A marzo 2024 alcuni allevatori hanno notato che i loro animali iniziavano a comportarsi in maniera insolita e l'hanno segnalato. Alcune settimane dopo, il 30 aprile, il Dipartimento dell'agricoltura degli Usa (Usda) ha confermato «la presenza del virus di influenza aviaria ad alta patogenicità» in 34 allevamenti di mucche da latte in 9 Stati americani. L'annuncio ha avuto effetti immediati, soprattutto perché il virus si è dimostrato capace di diffondersi da un allevamento all'altro. «Se molti lavoratori delle aziende lattiero-casearie contraggono l’H5N1», il virus aviario che circola tra le mucche in diversi stati Usa, «rischiamo una pandemia». Jennifer B. Nuzzo, Lauren Sauer e Nahid Bhadelia, tre accademiche americane, lo scandiscono a chiare lettere in un intervento pubblicato sul ’Washington Post’. Le misure «giustamente disposte» dal Dipartimento dell’Agricoltura per evitare che l’influenza aviaria si diffonda tra gli allevamenti bovini anche in altri stati del Paese, avvertono le tre esperte,

Il governatore della Liguria si trova da 24 ore ai domiciliari con l’accusa di corruzione e le sue funzioni sono state affidante ad interim al leghista Alessandro Piana, vicepresidente della Regione e assessore all’Agricoltura. Il primo, domani, a essere convocato per l’interrogatorio di garanzia è invece Paolo Emilio Signorini, ex presidente dell’Autorità portuale e ad di Iren (sospeso), detenuto nel carcere di Marassi. Sabato 11 maggio, invece, compariranno davanti al giudice due tra i principali indagati dell’inchiesta anticorruzione della procura di Genova: l’imprenditore Aldo Spinelli e Matteo Cozzani, capo di gabinetto e braccio destro di Toti. Proprio a casa di Spinelli, la Guardia di Finanza ha trovato 220 mila euro in contanti e valuta estera. Il denaro fa parte dei 570 mila euro sequestrati dal giudice per le indagini preliminari Paola Faggioni.\n\nDonzelli: “Diamogli il tempo di chiarire” – E mentre continuano a emergere altre novità relative all’ultima indagine anticorruzione che ha colpito la politica, la coalizione di Toti continua a tenere un atteggiamento di difesa nei confronti del governatore ai domiciliari. Tutto il centrodestra ha escluso per il momento l’ipotesi dimissioni per Toti: da Genova a Roma va registrata l’intenzione di tenere per il momento in vita. la giunta regionale. La speranza della destra è che Toti riesca a ottenere presto la revoca dei domiciliari in modo di tornare al comando. Sulla questione, in ogni caso, va registrato il silenzio assoluto di Giorgia Meloni. Nei ranghi di Fratelli d’Italia interviene Giovanni Donzelli. “Credo che prima di parlare di elezioni ci debbano essere i tempi necessari. Toti dice che non ha nessun coinvolgimento, diamogli il tempo di dimostrarlo. Noi chiediamo massima chiarezza in questo caso come l’abbiamo chiesta in Puglia e Piemonte. Massima attenzione perché quando si parla della cosa pubblica ci deve essere la massima trasparenza”, dice il responsabile organizzazione di FdI. Il principale partito di governo, dunque, non intende chiedere il passo indietro del governatore ai domiciliari. “Abbiamo avuto in passato la nostra sindaca di Terracina stata arrestata e scelse di dimettersi. Poi non è stata nemmeno rinviata a giudizio, su richiesta della Procura”, dice sempre Donzelli. “Non ho mai avuto occasione di pensare che il governatore della Regione Liguria agisse in modo sconsiderato, scorretto o addirittura, come gli viene attribuito, in modo lesivo delle normative”, assicura invece il ministro dell’Agricoltura Francesco Lollobrigida. “Abbiamo visto che è un’inchiesta che oramai credo sia di quattro anni fa, è iniziata quattro anni fa. A venti giorni dal voto ha ritenuto ci fossero gli elementi per arrivare a un’azione così forte, e quindi aspettiamo l’esito del giudizio della magistratura, auspicando e sperando, come è normale che sia, che le persone coinvolte sappiano dimostrare la loro innocenza”, ha aggiunto il cognato della premier.\n\nLEGGI ANCHE\nToti arrestato, l’uomo di Esselunga a Brunetta: “Vendiamo il tuo vino se parli con Giovanni”. I cellulari spenti per sfuggire alle intercettazioni\n\nI vicepremier fanno quadrato – Più spinto il commento di Matteo Salvini, che già ieri aveva difeso Toti. “Dimettersi sarebbe una resa, dal mio punto di vista. Perché domani qualunque inchiesta, avviso di garanzia o rinvio a giudizio porterebbe alle dimissioni di un sindaco”, sostiene il ministro delle Infrastrutture e dei Trasporti. “Non sono nelle condizioni di suggerire niente a Giovanni, che ritengo un ottimo amministratore – aggiunge il leader della Lega – Ritengo che in Italia e in tutti i Paesi civili chiunque sia colpevole, se condannato nei tre gradi di giudizio, non basta un’inchiesta. Lo invito a dimostrare che ha lavorato correttamente e spero che i giudici gli diano velocemente la possibilità di farlo”. L’altro vicepremier, cioè Antonio Tajani, sembra invece evocare una sorta di giustizia a orologeria. Più o meno come aveva fatto ieri il guardasigilli Carlo Nordio. “Il ministro ha un ruolo e può dire ciò che pensa. Fa bene e condivido le sue parole”, dice il ministro degli Esteri. “Questa – aggiunge – è vicenda giudiziaria che risale a vicende di parecchi anni fa, forse si poteva intervenire due mesi fa, il giorno dopo le elezioni… Però questo non ci turba, non ci preoccupa nulla”. Ma siccome il centrodestra aveva chiesto le dimissioni di Michele Emiliano, neanche indagato nelle varie inchieste della procura di Bari, come mai adesso nessuno auspica il passo indietro per Toti: “Le vicende giudiziarie sono diverse. Emiliano ha detto due volte di essere andato dalla sorella del boss”, si limita a dire Tajani. Che poi nega imbarazzo da parte della sua coalizione e dribbla anche la domanda sul possibile voto anticipato in Regione: “È una cosa che riguarda i cittadini della Liguria. Non strumentalizziamo le vicende giudiziarie, vediamo che cosa accade. Ma non mi pare un motivo per decidere adesso di andare a votare”.\n\nLEGGI ANCHE\nToti arrestato: le cene in barca con Spinelli e le pratiche da accelerare in cambio di fondi. “Ci sono le elezioni, serve una mano”. La Gip: “Funzione pubblica svenduta”\n\nLe indagini – Dalle carte dell’indagine, intanto, emerge come la procura di Genova stia approfondendo la posizione su altri imprenditori, non solo quelli che compaiono tra gli indagati. La gip Faggioni ne fa un cenno esplicito nella parte in cui spiega le esigenze cautelari per il governatore e la ”sorprendente disinvoltura con cui Toti manifesta il proposito di ricorrere a richieste di denaro agli imprenditori, sfruttando la momentanea soddisfazione per gli obiettivi imprenditoriali realizzati anche in seguito al proprio intervento”. Ad esempio, in una conversazione all’indomani della proroga della concessione trentennale del Terminal Rinfuse, Toti esclama “va beh con l’anno nuovo bisogna fare il giro di tutti i grandi del porto…Aponte…Spinelli è abbastanza tranquillo se Signorini gli dà quel…”. E ancora più significativa “è l’emersione, dalle indagini di ulteriori vicende (ancora oggetto di approfondimenti investigativi) che hanno visto il coinvolgimento di ulteriori imprenditori e nelle quali, a fronte di richieste di interessamento per pratiche amministrative di loro interesse, sono seguite elargizioni di finanziamenti in favore del Comitato Toti”. Il riferimento è a un dialogo del 17 maggio del 2021 in cui Luigi Alberto Amico (che non risulta indagato) nel corso di un incontro con Matteo Cozzani, capo di gabinetto del presidente Toti finito anche lui ai domiciliari, gli chiede una “mano” per capire “come meglio supportarvi e poi per capire come è il termometro politico“. Amico dopo avere precisato che la sua intenzione era ”continuare” a finanziare Toti e che, in cambio, “non chiedeva la luna” ma chiedeva solo “un’attenzione legittima”, precisava che “sono 6 anni che aspettiamo il rinnovo della concessione mi farebbe piacere quella..pizzico più di attenzione…noi siamo abbastanza allineati…” si legge nell’ordinanza. Poco tempo dopo l’incontro, il 7 giugno 2021, “veniva riscontrato un finanziamento della cifra di 30.000 euro in favore del Comitato Toti (di cui 10.000 euro transitati la settimana successiva sul conto dedicato del presidente Toti), operazione che veniva segnalata come sospetto dalla Banca d’Italia, analogamente a quanto verificatosi con riferimento ai finanziamenti erogati dal gruppo Colucci (su cui sono in corso ancora accertamenti).

sarà accertato - per commettere reati\". Il presidente del Senato Ignazio La Russa, intervenuto a Ping pong su Rai Radio 1, dice la sua sul caso dell'insegnante italiana e attivista antifascista detenuta da oltre un anno in Ungheria, con l'accusa di aver partecipato al pestaggio di un militante di estrema destra in strada a Budapest. \n\nPochi giorni fa, Nicola Fratoianni e Angelo Bonelli hanno annunciato di averla candidata alle Europee tra le fila di Alleanza Verdi e Sinistra. \"Mi auguro che non incida sulla valutazione dei magistrati ungheresi - annota La Russa -. La politicizzazione eccessiva non è andata a favore degli arresti domiciliari. Però è tutto lecito. Ognuno - conclude - fa le proprie scelte. Io ho apprezzato nella Salis che si è candidata nel partito più vicino alle idee che ha professato. E' stata coerente. Si candida con i suoi compagni\". \n\n \n\n \n\nIlaria Salis fuori: il sondaggio Ghisleri, cosa accadrebbe se si votasse oggi\n\n \n\nSulla Salis è intervenuto anche Patrick Zaki, lo studente egiziano dell'Università di Bologna anche lui detenuto per mesi nelle carceri del Cairo, in condizioni durissime. \"Voglio ricordare da qui il trattamento e le umiliazioni che sta subendo Ilaria in carcere in Ungheria. Spero che anche lei abbia lo stesso supporto dell'Italia che ho avuto io\". \"Io mi sento un privilegiato a essere un uomo libero - aggiunge intervenendo all'Università Kore di Enna dove ha incontrato gli studenti - ma non voglio e non posso dimenticare chi oggi è in difficoltà\".\n\n \n\n \n\n\"Una fuorilegge come me\": Mimmo Lucano-choc, gongola per Ilaria Salis\n\n \n\nIn una lettera spedita al caposervizio del Resto del Carlino edizione Reggio Emilia, intanto, Roberto Salis, padre di Ilaria, ha sottolineato come la figlia sia stata \"incarcerata e trattata in modo disumano dal governo ungherese\". E ancora: \"Incatenata ai piedi e alle mani, sottoposta a un processo senza garanzie\". \"Il caso di mia figlia è emblematico di come l'Unione Europea non dovrebbe trattare i suoi cittadini - aggiunge - Ho letto la lettera 'Perché si demonizza Vannacci e non la Salis?' di Giorgio Sesena. Pur comprendendo il desiderio di evidenziare le discrepanze nel trattamento di casi differenti, devo chiarire le differenze tra i due casi. Mia figlia è stata vittima di un grave maltrattamento giudiziario. Non è un ufficiale militare o un politico, ma una giovane donna ingiustamente accusata e privata dei diritti fondamentali. Il trattamento disumano che ha subito, con catene ai piedi e alle mani, va contro i principi di giustizia e umanità che l'Unione Europea rappresenta. E mi sembra molto grave la sua giustificazione del motivo per cui la candidatura di mia figlia a suo avviso dovrebbe essere impedita: 'Non ha mostrato contenuti politici meritori di candidatura europea'. Auspicare, come lei lascia intendere, che le candidature alle elezioni siano vagliate da una non meglio specificata 'Commissione Meriti Politici' è un po' lontano dai valori democratici che ispirano le culture occidentali ed Europee, a eccezione dell'Ungheria di Orban\". \n\n \n\n \n\n\"Non solo il fascista Orban\": italiano pestato a Miami, la lezione di Mario Giordano alla sinistra | Video\n\n \n\n\"Le elezioni europee - conclude papà Salis - non sono basate su listini bloccati in cui il politico di turno riesce a imporre agli elettori il seggio per il figlio di o l'amante di. Il sistema elettorale europeo prevede le preferenze sui candidati ed è il Demos cioè il popolo che stabilisce chi ha il merito politico per poter ottenere il seggio. Col suo metodo della Commissione Meriti Politici, Giuseppe Di Vittorio nelle elezioni del 1921 non avrebbe certamente superato le forche caudine della selezione del comitato che lei auspica, visto che si trovava nelle patrie galere, come mia figlia Ilaria, per i moti sociali del 1920/21. E l'Italia avrebbe perso il talento e il contributo di quello che ha rappresentato il più grande sindacalista della nostra storia. Per cui caro Saverio lasciamo decidere al popolo chi ha meriti politici e chi no ed evitiamo di importare in Italia i criteri selettivi della classe politica usati nelle Democrazie Illiberali, e

al caviale e San Silvestro da 1.400 euro: i cibi luculliani di Toti e Signorini pagati da Spinelli","description":"\"Una via crucis di 18 pasti... leggendaria\": le intercettazioni","article_body":"Sui social le foto con la focaccia di Recco e il pesto di Prà, durante il Covid i giri nei ristoranti per valorizzare il cibi del territorio. Per festeggiare a bordo dello yacht di Aldo Spinelli, però, Giovanni Toti preferiva altro: “Porta un po’ di caviale da Monaco, che la settimana prossima veniamo a mangiare una patata col caviale”. Il Principato era un po’ il crocevia dei pasti luculliani dei due presunti corrotti, secondo la procura di Genova, dall’imprenditore portuale. L’altro, Paolo Emilio Signorini, ex presidente dell’Autorità portuale genovese, avrebbe invece beneficiato di diversi soggiorni in hotel di lusso e poi pranzi e cene, compreso un cenone di San Silvestro nel 2021 da 1.466,86 per due persone.\n\nIl caviale da Monaco: “Lo mangiamo con la patata” – Era sempre l’occasione di festeggiare. Il 9 febbraio 2022, poco dopo la visita dell’allora presidente del Consiglio Mario Draghi, Toti e Spinelli si sentono telefonicamente. Il governatore ligure chiede all’ex presidente di Genoa e Livorno se avesse apprezzato le rassicurazioni di Draghi sulla realizzazione della diga foranea. “No guarda… Sono veramente, non felice, di voi tre, ma di più, perché immagino che quello sia un colpo veramente eccezionale… Ma siete stati veramente bravi, perché io è 30 anni che lotto per la diga”, si congratula Spinelli, come si legge nell’ordinanza, con un riferimento che per la giudice per le indagini preliminare è a Toti, a Signorini e al sindaco di Genova, Marco Bucci, non indagato. Toti coglie l’occasione: “Ora ci vediamo a festeggiare, dai, porta un po’ di caviale da Monaco, che la settimana prossima veniamo a mangiare una patata col caviale in barca”. In quella circostanza, sempre secondo la giudice, Spinelli “avendo perfettamente compreso le finalità dell’incontro (volta ad ottenere dei finanziamenti)” accettava la proposta di Toti, non lasciandosi però sfuggire l’occasione per “mettere sul piatto” anche un ulteriore argomento di interesse per il proprio gruppo imprenditoriale: “Eh va bè dai… Vediamo il Piano Regolatore, dai! Ok!”.\n\n“Da Aponte mangi di m…” – Tre mesi prima, l’1 dicembre 2021, in un altro incontro tra Toti e Spinelli, presente anche Signorini, si mescolano ancora questioni tecniche e cibo. Tra un augurio e l’altro di poter festeggiare a Montecarlo il rinnovo della concessione delle rinfuse, una di quelle al centro dell’indagine, Spinelli parla del suo socio Gianluigi Aponte, non coinvolto nell’inchiesta: “Al suo tavolo quello rotondo che lo hai visto che ha fatto adesso, s’è fatto la mensa sopra non va più al suo circolo”. L’armatore, continua, “c’ha un tavolo rotondo così che gli parli col microfono, tra io e lui poi mangi di merda che…”. Interviene Toti: “Ma si perché non c’ha più il circolo glielo avranno chiuso eee… per le norme Covid”. E ancora Spinelli insiste sulla qualità del cibo: “Va beh. .. mangi di me… Paolo che te lo dico va beh lascia perdere…”. E Toti ci tiene a precisare che “intanto anche di là mangiavi abbastanza di merda… non è che è cambiato granché…”.\n\nLe cene e i pranzi di Signorini – Non mangiava di certo male invece Signorini a Montecarlo, a giudicare dal prezzo dei pasti. Tutto o quasi spesato da Spinelli, sostiene la procura. La notte di San Silvestro del 2021, l’ex presidente dell’Autorità portuale e la compagna “hanno fruito di una cena presso il ristorante Salle des Etoiles” all’interno dello Sporting d’Ete, insieme ad altre cinque persone. La cena, costata in totale 5.134 euro, era “interamente a carico del Casinò di Monte Carlo in virtù dei benefici riconosciuti ad Aldo Spinelli ed ai suoi ospiti”, poiché l’ex presidente di Genoa e Livorno aveva uno “status privè” che “gli consente di essere pienamente supportato dal Casinò e beneficiare dei servizi di invito per lui ed i suoi ospiti”. A testa, insomma, è la stima della giudice per le indagini preliminari, costò 733,43 euro. Il cenone di Signorini e consorte, insomma, costò all’imprenditore 1.466,86 euro. Il giorno successivo, il pranzo di Capodanno, sempre a Montecarlo e ancora spesato, costò altri 430 euro.\n\nLa “via crucis” di 18 pasti: “Leggendaria” – Spinelli però ogni tanto si lamentava dei costi. In una conversazione apostrofa Signorini come una “pigna secca” dopo una cena costata 600 euro, sottintendendo che “fosse notoriamente ‘persona taccagna’ e mal propenso a pagare di tasca propria”, precisa il giudice. “Ma perché hai preso lo champagne”, la risposta del suo interlocutore che poi consigliava a Spinelli di “ordinare del semplice vino alludendo al fatto” che Signorini e un’altra persona “non fossero abituali a concedersi autonomamente tali lussi”. Di vacanza in vacanza, capitava anche che Signorini dimenticasse lo champagne nelle vetture prese a noleggio. Una volta, dopo essere rientrato dal Principato, viene chiamato dal responsabile: “Volevo dirle questo, dentro il bagagliaio della macchina… abbiamo trovato una bottiglia di champagne”. Signorini era certo “di averle tolte tutte” e “invitava l’uomo a prendere la bottiglia, considerandola un omaggio per la loro lunga conoscenza”. Era stata una vacanza di grandi fatiche prandiali, trascorsa in una junior suite all’Hotel de Paris: “Stavo ripensando, ieri sera, per addormentarmi, ho trovato la forza – dice in un’intercettazione – di ripercorrere la via crucis dei diciotto pasti che abbiamo inanellato”.

Sarebbe stato questo l'obiettivo di una rete di agenti russi che tramavano per uccidere il presidente ucraino, secondo il servizio di sicurezza ucraino Sbu che ha scoperto il piano.\n\nArrestati due colonnelli ucraini: alto tradimento\n\nL'operazione di controspionaggio ha portato all'arresto di due colonnelli ucraini, accusati di alto tradimento e favoreggiamento di un attacco terroristico per aver collaborato con i servizi russi. A Mosca, in occasione dell'insediamento di Putin ha fatto discutere la presenza di rappresentanti di alcuni paesi europei nonostante la linea di Bruxelles fosse quella di disertare la cerimonia L'Ue non ha mandato il suo ambasciatore, ma alcuni Stati membri, Francia, Ungheria, Slovacchia, Grecia, Cipro e Malta, hanno deciso in autonomia e hanno inviato i loro rappresentanti diplomatici. La tensione resta alta in vista del 9 maggio, Giornata della vittoria sul nazifascismo celebrata a Mosca.\n\n \n\nLanciati sull'Ucraina 55 missili e 21 droni\n\nMosca del resto attacca con sempre maggiore potenza. Oggi 8 maggio, secondo Zelensky, sono stati lanciati sull’Ucraina non meno di 55 missili e 21 droni. Bombardamenti hanno colpito le infrastrutture ucraine, in  particolare centrali elettriche. I sistemi di difesa aerea di Kiev hanno hanno intercettato 39 missili e 20 droni\n\n \n\nZelensky: Putin è un nazista e il mondo lo deve capire\n\n\"Massiccio attacco missilistico del Putin nazista nel Giorno della Memoria e vittoria sul nazismo nella Seconda Guerra Mondiale. Più di 50 razzi e più di 20 droni 'shahed' sulle infrastrutture nelle regioni di Leopoli, Vinnytsia, Kyiv, Poltava, Kirovohrad, Zaporizhzhya, Ivano-Frankivsk. Tutti i servizi necessari sono già operativi sul territorio per eliminare le conseguenze del terrorismo\". Lo scrive su Telegram il presidente ucraino, Volodymyr Zelensky. \"Il mondo intero dovrebbe capire chiaramente chi è chi. Il mondo intero non ha il diritto di dare un'altra possibilità al nazismo\", ha scritto ancora.\n\n\n\n\n\nNews correlate\nG7 Esteri, Tajani: aiutare l'Ucraina, altrimenti Putin non negozierà mai\n\nIl ministro degli Esteri ha aperto la riunione odierna dei capi della diplomazia del G7, riuniti a Capri sotto la presidenza...\n\nIsraele risponderà all’attacco dell’Iran\n\nDomenico Rossi, già generale corpo d’armata dell’Esercito: tutto dipende da dove e come lo farà.

is everything': Buckingham Palace raises eyebrows","description":"Last night, Buckingham Palace announced that Prince William and his father would be attending a joint engagement next week, where the

Buckingham Palace announced that Prince William and his father would be attending a joint engagement next week, where the heir will be made the Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps.\n\nPrior to Prince Harry's decision to step back from royal life four years ago, it was always thought he would take on the role that would see him take charge of the regiment he was toured Afghanistan with until 2014.\n\nThe announcement that the King would pass on the role he held for 31 years to his eldest son came just two hours after he said he was too busy to see his youngest son.\n\n'Timing is everything,' one royal insider said, while another said the monarch's decision not to see the Duke of Sussex during whistle stop visit to the UK - despite only being three miles apart - 'will be widely perceived as a snub'.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex flew into London from California yesterday as he marks the tenth anniversary of his Invictus Games yet due to the King's busy schedule was unable to meet his father.\n\nHarry's spokesperson confirmed that it was 'unfortunately not possible' for the pair to meet 'due to His Majesty's full programme', as he returns to public duties after undergoing treatment for cancer.\n\nFollowing much speculation over whether the Duke would pop in to visit his father, who he last saw in February following his shocking diagnosis, Harry's spokesperson confirmed there was no time for a reunion.\n\n+\n10\nView gallery\n\nKing Charles ' timing raised a few eyebrows yesterday after he dealt two blows to Prince Harry within a matter of hours.

Pictured: The brothers together in 2022\n\n'In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not The Duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme,' he said.\n\n'The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.'\n\nHarry had been at the Honourable Artillery Company in London appearing on a stage during a discussion called Realising Global Community.\n\nHis father was just down the road at Clarence House before holding an audience at nearby Buckingham Palace with the Prime Minister of Fiji, Sitiveni Rabuka.\n\nInstead of catching up with his estranged father, the Duke enjoyed dinner with city financier Guy Monson last night.\n\n'This, whatever the logistics, will be widely perceived as a snub,' royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams told MailOnline.\n\n'This is one of the most public rifts in the world. If it was handled in private without so much press speculation, it would have a better chance of being resolved.'\n\nEchoing the same sentiment, former BBC Royal correspondent Michael Cole added: 'It is quite a snub. For the King to not see his younger son, Prince Harry, although the two men will be only two miles apart tomorrow afternoon, gives an indication of the depth of the divide.\n\n+\n10\nView gallery\n\nPrince Harry, patron of the Invictus Games Foundation, on stage during a discussion titled 'Realising a Global Community' at the Honourable Artillery Company in London yesterday\n\n+\n10\nView gallery\n\nKing Charles III is pictured holding papers as he arrives at Clarence House in London yesterday\n\n+\n10\nView gallery\n\nHarry was three miles away from Charles at the Invictus Games discussion in London today\n\n'The Prodigal Son is not welcome - not for the present, anyway. In royal terms, this is big medicine. Prince Harry is bound to see it for what it is, the clearest possible indication of the hurt that has been caused.\n\n'There can be no mistake: this is a royal flea in the ear for the fifth in line to the throne. Actions have consequences but rarely are they played out as starkly as they are here.\n\n'Even Prince Harry, never the sharpest sword in the Household Cavalry, is bound to have got the message and many people will say, ''About time too''.'\n\nJust two hours after the revelation that Charles and Harry would not meet Buckingham Palace announced Prince William's new role.\n\nA statement read: 'At the Army Aviation Centre in Middle Wallop, His Majesty The King will officially hand over the role of Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps to His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales.\n\n'In August 2023, following His Majesty's Accession, The King was pleased to announce military appointments including that The Prince of Wales would become Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps.\n\n'The role was previously held by His Majesty The King, as Prince of Wales, for 31 years.'\n\n+\n10\nView gallery\n\nThe Duke of Sussex instead went to dinner with Guy Monson, who attended the unveiling of a statue of  Princess Diana in 2021 at Kensington Palace (pictured left, at the unveiling)\n\n+\n10\nView gallery\n\nPrince Harry will give a reading at a service of thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral - marking a decade since the inaugural competition in London in 2014.

or children Archie and Lilibet would also be in the UK.\n\nBut Harry arrived in London by himself today, and is expected to join the Duchess on a tour to Nigeria later this week with Meghan set to fly

a Berlino la socialdemocratica Franziska Giffey","description":"Ferita alla testa, le sua condizioni non sono gravi","article_body":"BERLINO. La politica socialdemocratica tedesca Franziska Giffey, attualmente senatrice con delega all'Economia dell'amministrazione berlinese, ha subito un attacco da ignoti ed è finita in ospedale con una ferita alla testa, per fortuna di natura non grave. Lo ha reso noto la polizia. L'ex sindaca della capitale, che ha lavorato anche come ministra della Famiglia al fianco di Angela Merkel in passato, è stata aggredita ieri nel quartiere di Neukoelln.

Gruber, il richiamo di Cairo per rassicurare Mentana: fondamentale mantenere il rispetto reciproco a La7","description":"Dopo il botta e risposta tra i due giornalisti in diretta tv, arriva il richiamo dell’editore","article_body":"ROMA. Dopo lo scontro a distanza tra Lili Gruber ed Enrico Mentana arriva l’intervento dell’editore Urbano Cairo per placare gli animi. In una nota comunica che «La7 sta conseguendo ottimi risultati grazie al contributo di tutti e ad un prezioso lavoro di squadra. Per questo è fondamentale che non venga mai a mancare il rispetto reciproco. Così come è fondamentale che non manchi il rispetto verso un'Azienda che ha nei suoi valori fondanti la libertà di espressione e l'autonomia responsabile dei suoi conduttori e giornalisti».\n\nLilli Gruber: \"Benvenuti alle 20.46 e non a Otto e mezzo\". E attacca Mentana: \"L'incontinenza è una brutta cosa\"\n\nDopo il duro botta e risposta tra i due in diretta tv andato in scena nei giorni scorsi Cairo ha sottolineato che La7 è «un'azienda che ha saputo negli anni mantenere e ampliare il livello di occupazione, risanarsi economicamente, e diventare un punto di riferimento di eccellenza nel panorama informativo e culturale italiano. Per questo va preservata e tutelata sempre da parte di tutti noi, che ci lavoriamo quotidianamente con passione e orgoglio», si legge nella nota a firma dell'editore.\n\nIeri sera il direttore del TgLa7 Enrico Mentana aveva chiesto all'azienda di intervenire. «Altrimenti traggo le conclusioni e le dovute conseguenze», aveva detto.\n\nMentana: \"Offeso da Gruber, se l'azienda tace ne trarrò le

I giornaloni che strizzano l'occhio ai progressisti infatti hanno pubblicato questa mattina alcune conversazioni telefoniche del governatore della Liguria. Secondo l'accusa Giovanni Toti avrebbe incontrato Aldo Spinelli sullo yacht Leila di proprietà dell'imprenditore.\n\nE secondo quanto riporta ilCorriere, Aldo Spinelli e il figlio Roberto, avrebbero avito la necessità di trasformare la spiaggia libera di Punta dell'Olmo in un lussuoso resort. E così l'1 settembre 2021 Toti avrebbe pranzato a bordo dello yacht. Poi la telefonata a un consigliere regionale: \"Bisogna trovare una soluzione\". Il consigliere risponde così: \"Me la devi trovare tu caro Gio!\". \"Ci mettiamo lì… ma razionalizziamo le libere che ci sono attrezzate, accorpiamo, spostiamo, intanto ci mettiamo un piede dentro, poi vediamo\", avrebbe detto Toti. Poi il governatore avrebbe chiamato Paolo Emilio Signorini, presidente dell'Autorità Portuale Paolo Emilio Signorini.\n\n \n\nDieci punti che non tornano contro Giovanni Toti: chi ci guadagna dal caos\n\n \n\nAl centro del colloquio ci sarebbe, sempre secondo l'accusa, la proroga della concessione su 100 mila metri quadrati dell’arenile del Terminal portuale Rinfuse: \"Sono buttato in barca da... da Aldo, quando gliela portiamo sta proroga in Comitato, che così (…) possiamo ragionare (…) e lo mettiamo tranquillo\", avrebbe detto Toti. Il presidente dell’Autorità risponde così: \"Digli di stare tranquillissimo (…) noi nel giro di due settimane facciamo tutto\".  Toti ride: \"Dice che due settimane son tante (…) vediamo di farlo il prima possibile\".

horror of 14-year-old girl - 'organised by her boyfriend'","description":"The girl, who remains unidentified for privacy reasons, was allegedly lured into a wooded area in Kortrijk, West Flanders, by her teenage boyfriend over the Easter school break","article_body":"Prosecutors have opened an investigation into the sickening gang rape of a 14-year-old girl in a wooded area in Belgium who is thought to have been abused by up to a dozen other minors.\n\nThe girl, who remains unidentified for privacy reasons, was allegedly lured into a wooded area called Kabouterbos in Kortrijk, West Flanders, by her teenage boyfriend over the Easter school break. \n\nUpon enticing her into the forest, close to an area used by mountain bikers, the boyfriend is said to have attacked his young partner before allegedly allowing several other boys to have their way with her. \n\nProsecutors confirmed they had arrested the suspected perpetrators and hauled them in for questioning, though would not specify the exact number of suspects or confirm their ages.\n\nBut sources told Belgian outlet Nieuwsblad there were up to a dozen suspects involved, the youngest of which is scarcely 12 years old, and the oldest of which is just 16.\n\n+\n3\nView gallery\n\nThe girl, who remains unidentified for privacy reasons, was allegedly lured into a wooded area in Kortrijk, West Flanders, by her

the West Flanders prosecutor's office to avoid any chance of horrified family members of the victim and aghast members of the public learning the identities of those involved. \n\nBut Nieuwsblad reported prosecutors turned up 'reprehensible behaviour' on the part of the suspects and 'revenge-mongering facts', citing sources close to the investigation who said the alleged perpetrators showed 'a complete lack of sense of norms'. \n\nThe girl is thought to have spent two days in the forest where she was tormented and abused by the gang of minors.  \n\nThe criminal age of responsibility in Belgium is 18, meaning the suspected sexual abusers were sent before a juvenile judge and are likely to have been placed into a personal rehabilitation programme in youth facilities. \n\nBut it is possible the 16-year-old in question could be dealt with under adult criminal law, given the exceptional nature of the case. \n\nIt is not clear whether each suspect was equally guilty or to what

hanno aggredito e ucciso il bambino di 13 mesi in località Campolongo di Eboli, nel Salernitano. È quanto si legge in una nota dell’Organizzazione internazionale protezione animali (Oipa) che si congratula con i magistrati che hanno preso questa decisione che \"va nel rispetto della vita dei due animali e che dà loro una prospettiva di recupero\". \"Al momento - viene aggiunto dall’Oipa - i cani sono in un rifugio nel Casertano e, a quanto si apprende, dovranno essere sottoposti a un percorso di rieducazione a Napoli\".\n\nL’auspicio dell’Oipa è che \"questo indirizzo della Procura di Salerno faccia scuola e che sia un modello da seguire in casi analoghi dove cani ’impegnativì siano protagonisti di episodi di aggressione più o meno gravi\". L’associazione, intanto, \"torna a chiedere al legislatore di regolamentare la detenzione di determinati tipi di cani che troppo spesso vengono scelti anche da persone non in grado di gestirli correttamente\".\n\n \n\nBambina di 2 anni azzannata alla testa dal cane degli amici: perché è stata attaccata\n\n \n\nIntanto qualche giorno fa si è consumata un'altra aggressione. Un bambino di 10 anni è stato portato in ospedale, qualche sera fa, dopo essere stato attaccato e ferito dal pitbull di famiglia. L’incidente è si è verificato a Milano.

gene nelle cellule tumorali che diventano così «invisibili» al sistema immunitario. A scoprirlo è uno studio condotto dall’IRCCS Candiolo, i cui risultati sono stati pubblicati sulle pagine della rivista Blood.\n\nIl meccanismo\n\n«Il farmaco bortezomib inibitore del proteasoma, organuli cellulari in grado di rimuovere le cellule danneggiate, contrasta il mieloma multiplo sia direttamente, colpendo le cellule tumorali, che indirettamente, attivando il sistema immunitario e provocando la cosiddetta morte cellulare immunogenica – spiega Annamaria Gullà, responsabile del Laboratorio di Ematologia Traslazionale e Immunologia di Candiolo -. La perdita di efficacia a lungo termine del farmaco può derivare dall’insorgenza di forme nuove di resistenza alla terapia, in cui il farmaco non è più in grado di stimolare il sistema immunitario a riconoscere il tumore. A causa della perdita di un gene noto come “Gabarap”, infatti, il mieloma multiplo diventa “invisibile” al riconoscimento da parte del sistema immunitario».\n\nI numeri\n\nIl mieloma multiplo è il secondo tumore del sangue per frequenza in Italia colpisce ogni anno circa 2700 donne e 3000 uominied è provocato da un’eccessiva riproduzione delle plasmacellule nel midollo osseo. La maggior parte delle persone con mieloma ha una recidiva di malattia dopo il primo trattamento. Con il progredire della malattia, il susseguirsi delle recidive e dei trattamenti, il mieloma diventa sempre più difficile da trattare. «L’attuale paradigma terapeutico per il mieloma multiplo comprende una terapia di combinazione che può includere agenti immunomodulatori, inibitori del proteasoma, corticosteroidi e anticorpi monoclonali anti-CD38 – afferma Gullà -. Tuttavia, numerosi pazienti recidivano e/o diventano refrattari a queste classi terapeutiche. Per questo i nostri sforzi sono concentrati sulla ricerca di nuove armi più efficaci per prolungare la risposta a lungo termine e migliorare la qualità di vita dei pazienti».\n\nNuova frontiera\n\n«I risultati di questo lavoro sono un’ulteriore dimostrazione del nostro impegno continuo rivolto alla ricerca di nuovi approcci per la terapia dei tumori, anche quelli più difficili da curare, come appunto il mieloma multiplo – commenta Salvatore Nieddu, direttore Generale dell’Irccs Oncologico del Piemonte di Candiolo -. Questo specifico tumore del sangue sembra essere in grado di difendersi dai farmaci attualmente in uso tramite diversi meccanismi di resistenza. È quindi necessario sviluppare un armamentario sempre più ricco di farmaci che, combinati assieme, possano ridurre o evitare che il tumore sviluppi la capacità di resistere ai

E io ho risposto....","article_body":"Esplora:\nrocco buttiglione quora\nCondividi:\n \n \n \n\nSalvatore Dama 08 maggio 2024\na a a\n\nParliamo di Quora. Come l’ha scoperto?\n«Due o tre anni fa mi hanno scritto invitandomi a rispondere ad alcune domande. E io ho risposto. Poi quelli a cui ho risposto mi hanno risposto. Io ci ho preso gusto e ho continuato».\n\nChi l’ha invitata?\n«Ah, non mi faccia domande difficili, non mi ricordo. Immagino gli amministratori di Quora. In quel periodo avevano coinvolto anche altre persone. Una di queste era Michelle Obama».\n\nIstruzioni per boomer: Quora è un social network particolare. Non ci sono foto o video, gli utenti interagiscono facendo domande e dando risposte. Clima rilassato, pochi odiatori, è una comunità animata dal dubbio, non dalle certezze. In questa bolla non si esibisce l’addome, ma la conoscenza. E il nostro Fedez è Rocco Buttiglione. Sì, lui. Filosofo, ex ministro per le Politiche Comunitarie, ex leader centrista. Su Quora, quasi 2mila seguaci e 7.300 risposte fornite. Dalla politica estera ai consigli sentimentali. In italiano, inglese e spagnolo.\n\n \n\n \n\n\"Perché non trovo un ragazzo?\". E Buttiglione risponde così: la vita \"segreta\" dell'ex ministro | Guarda\n\n \n\nL’ha preso sul serio?\n«Un po’. Domandano e io rispondo».\n\nQuanto ci si dedica?\n«Ma no, è una cosa marginale. Quando ho tempo, magari quando sono in vacanza».\n\nUsa il telefonino?\n«Oppure il computer».\n\nCon che genere di persone interagisce?\n«Premessa: Internet mette a disposizione una quantità infinita di informazioni, ma non dà gli strumenti critici necessari per valutarle. E allora vengono fuori le domande più assurde, quelle che una volta erano le chiacchiere da bar. E sono domande di gente che vuole capire, ma non ha gli strumenti. Io cerco di affermare un metodo basato sulla logica e il controllo delle fonti, invito le persone a una valutazione critica. Le mie figlie dicono che questa è un’estensione della mia insopprimibile vocazione didattica».\n\nGli utenti sono giovani?\n«Giovani e meno giovani, è un pubblico eterogeneo. Io cerco di aiutare. Se vuoi capire la realtà devi conciliare fatti che sono opposti. Prendiamo Gaza: stanno succedendo cose terribili, ma non puoi valutare quei fatti senza ricordare l’assassinio di massa del 7 Ottobre. E andare poi indietro alle motivazioni dell’uno e dell’altro, e capire come si bilanciano torti e ragioni».\n\nSi trova spesso a dare risposte anche sulla sfera personale e sentimentale.\n«Sì, qualche volta».\n\nE?\n«Mi sono fatto l’idea che dietro molti sfoghi probabilmente ci sia una grande incertezza dei giovani. Hanno paura del sesso».\n\nPaura?\n«Il sesso è dinamite. Può rompere una montagna e farti arrivare a una miniera d’oro, ma può esplodere in mano e farti molto male. Io cerco di diminuire l’ansia e la paura dando alcune regole per l’uso».\n\n \n\n \n\nNichi Vendola, ci mancava il ritorno del cattocomunista in politica\n\n \n\nTipo?\n«Noi avevamo delle regole d’uso. La morale, in fondo, è una regola d'uso della realtà. Oggi i giovani, molto spesso, queste regole non ce le hanno. E allora hanno paura, giustamente. Si creano immagini fantastiche che non corrispondono alla realtà. Perché il grande problema della vita, uno dei più grandi, è l’incontro con il femminile o con il maschile».\n\nÈ un fatto generazionale?\n«Sì. Perché a questi ragazzi hanno detto: fate ciò che volete. Ma la domanda che loro pongono in realtà è: che cosa vale la pena di volere? E nessuno li aiuta a capire. Allora si ritirano. Ci sono studi americani interessanti che segnalano una forte diminuzione dell'attività sessuale, cui corrisponde l'aumento del sesso virtuale oppure la rinuncia alla dimensione sessuale, cioè una repressione assoluta autoimposta».\n\nTroppi porno.\n«L’amore non è solo istinto.Il rapporto con l’altro sesso chiede di essere contenuto in una relazione personale. Il sesso senza relazione personale è distruttivo... Però non mi faccia parlare solo di questo, eh!».\n\nParliamo di lei, che fine ha fatto?\n«Sono in viaggio tra la Polonia e Vienna. Convegni, workshop, corsi brevi, conferenze».\n\nÈ tornato a fare il prof.\n«Ma arrivati a 75 anni in Europa ti mettono in pensione. Sono presidente dell’Accademia dei leader latinoamericanos.

surprenante présence de l’ambassadeur de France à l’investiture de Vladimir Poutine","description":"ÉDITORIAL. La France a affiché un message de confusion plus que de fermeté en envoyant son ambassadeur au Kremlin, mardi, sans coordination avec ses principaux partenaires européens, à un moment d’extrême tension avec la Russie.","article_body":"L\na présence de l’ambassadeur de France, Pierre Lévy, parmi les rares diplomates occidentaux ayant accepté d’assister à la cérémonie d’investiture du président Vladimir Poutine, à Moscou, mardi 7 mai, avait de quoi surprendre, pour plusieurs raisons.\n\nLa première est que l’élection grâce à laquelle M. Poutine a obtenu un cinquième mandat présidentiel par 88,5 % des voix, du 15 au 17 mars, s’est déroulée dans des conditions si peu démocratiques que la France, comme la plupart des pays occidentaux, s’est contentée d’en prendre acte, soulignant que les électeurs russes avaient été privés d’un véritable choix et condamnant fermement le contexte de répression dans lequel elle s’est tenue. Pour mémoire, l’opposant Alexeï Navalny était mort un mois plus tôt en prison, mi-février, dans des conditions qui n’ont jamais été éclaircies – M. Lévy avait d’ailleurs assisté, avec ses collègues occidentaux, aux funérailles de l’opposant à Moscou. Il est donc d’autant plus paradoxal que la France envoie son ambassadeur cautionner, par sa présence, une élection dont elle a réprouvé les conditions.\n\nLire aussi | \nArticle réservé à nos abonnés\n Lors de son investiture, Vladimir Poutine inscrit dans la durée la confrontation avec l’Occident\n\nLa deuxième raison est que l’immense majorité des pays occidentaux ont boycotté cette cérémonie. Hormis la France, aucun pays du G7 n’était représenté. Pour ce qui concerne les pays de l’Union européenne (UE), l’ambassadeur de France s’est retrouvé en compagnie de ses seuls collègues de Hongrie, de Slovaquie – dont la complaisance à l’égard de Moscou est connue –, de Malte, de Chypre et de Grèce.\n\nL’ambassadeur de l’UE est resté ostensiblement chez lui. L’Allemagne a, pour sa part, choisi de rappeler son ambassadeur à Berlin pour consultations afin de marquer sa condamnation de cyberattaques attribuées à la Russie. A un moment où la France ne cesse de plaider et de promouvoir l’unité européenne, rompre ainsi les rangs revient à donner un signal de division incompréhensible. Les médias d’Etat russes ne se sont pas privés de le souligner.\n\nAmbiguïté\n\nLa troisième raison est que, la veille de la cérémonie d’investiture, le même ambassadeur de France avait été convoqué au ministère russe des affaires étrangères, pour la troisième fois depuis le début de l’année 2024, pour se voir reprocher la politique « provocatrice » des autorités françaises. Le Quai d’Orsay avait opportunément dénoncé ce « détournement des canaux diplomatiques à des fins de manipulation de l’information et d’intimidation ». Honorer le Kremlin de sa présence vingt-quatre heures après s’être fait tancer par son gouvernement est une étrange façon de manifester l’indignation de la France.\n\nLa quatrième raison, enfin, et pas la moindre, est que ce président intronisé mardi tel un tsar par le patriarche Kirill a, le 24 février 2022, fait envahir l’Ukraine, un Etat indépendant, sans raison et mène depuis une guerre d’agression à grande échelle qui secoue tout le continent européen. Une cinquantaine de pays, dont la France, sont engagés dans l’aide militaire à l’Ukraine contre la Russie. M. Poutine fait l’objet d’un mandat d’arrêt de la Cour pénale internationale pour crimes de guerre.\n\nEn guise de justification de la présence de son ambassadeur mardi, Paris a fait valoir que la France ne souhaitait pas « couper tous les ponts » avec la Russie. Préserver des canaux de communication en temps de guerre peut en effet être utile. Mais le faire de cette manière, sans coordination avec nos partenaires européens, au moment précis où la Russie hausse le ton en agitant de nouveau la menace nucléaire, contredit la position de grande

Dan Poulter made the same switch at the end of last month.  \n\nMs Elphicke - up until now regarded as on the right of the Conservatives - slammed Mr Sunak's 'broken promises' and 'tired and chaotic government'. She said the 'key deciding factors' for her had been 'housing and the safety and security of our borders'.\n\nIn a statement issued by Labour, she said: 'Today I announce that I have decided to join the Labour Party and that I will sit in Parliament as a Labour MP.\n\n'When I was elected in 2019, the Conservative Party occupied the centre ground of British politics. The party was about building the future and making the most of the opportunities that lay ahead for our country.\n\nPM and Starmer face off for first time after local election showdown\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\n0:00\nPrevious\nPlay\nSkip\nMute\nCurrent Time\n0:00\n/\nDuration Time\n3:49\nFullscreen\nNeed Text\n+\n7\nView gallery\n\nDover MP Natalie Elphicke announced she was crossing the floor just moments before Rishi Sunak faced a bruising PMQs session\n\n+\n7\nView gallery\n\nMr Sunak is under massive pressure following the local elections , with Tories urging him to get more hardline on issues such as migration and tax\n\n+\n7\nView gallery\n\nKeir Starmer seized on the news saying that it showed the government was collapsing, after Dan Poulter made a switch last month\n\n+\n7\nView gallery\n\nMs Elphicke was in a prime spot behind Sir Keir as the leaders clashed in another bad-tempered PMQs \n\n'Since then, many things have changed. The elected Prime Minister was ousted in a coup led by the unelected Rishi Sunak. \n\n'Under Rishi Sunak, the Conservatives have become a byword for incompetence and division. \n\n'The centre ground has been abandoned and key pledges of the 2019 manifesto have been ditched.'\n\nIncredulous Tories immediately began circulating previous comments by Ms Elphicke condemning Labour for its 'open borders' policy. \n\nFormer minister Stephen Hammond told Sky News he was 'staggered' by the defection. 'If there's someone who, as much as anyone, has dragged my party away from the centre in the last few years it's Natalie,' he said. \n\nOther MPs swiped that Sir Keir was taking the 'absolute dregs' of the party. \n\nSome in Labour were also uncomfortable about the shock move, while the Corbynite Momentum pressure group said Ms Elphicke had 'no place in a Labour Party committed to progressive values'. \n\nMs Elphicke had a 12,000 majority in Dover at the last election, and looked to have a good chance of holding the successor seat of Dover & Deal.\n\nHowever, she is now expected to stand down with Labour's existing candidate Mike Tapp remaining in place. \n\nA jubilant Sir Keir goaded Mr Sunak in the Commons, asking 'what is the point of this failed Government staggering on' when 'the Tory MP for Dover on the front line of small boats crisis says the Prime Minister cannot be trusted with our borders and joins Labour'. \n\n'Why doesn't he put it to the test and call a general election?' he said.\n\nSir Keir railed: 'The voters tell him it's not good enough, instead of listening he keeps telling them everything's fine, if only they realise his greatness. He just doesn't get it.\n\n'But at least after Thursday night he can go to the many places that he calls home and enjoy the fruits of his success. \n\n'In Southampton or Downing Street, he's got great Labour councils. At his mansion in Richmond he can enjoy a brand new Labour mayor of North Yorkshire. \n\n'At his pad in Kensington he can celebrate a historic third term for the Mayor of London.\n\n'Now that he too could enjoy the benefits of this changed Labour Party, is he really still in such a hurry to get back to California?'\n\nBut a bullish Mr Sunak lashed back: 'I was, of course, surprised to see (Sir Keir) in North Yorkshire but probably not as surprised as he was when he realised he couldn't take the Tube there.\n\n'I can tell him that the people of North Yorkshire believe in hard work, secure borders, lower taxes and straight-talking common sense, they're not going to get any of that from a virtue-signalling lawyer from north London.'\n\nMr Sunak is under massive pressure following the local elections, with Tories urging him to get more hardline on issues such as migration and tax. \n\nRebels have so far held off on an all-out coup attempt, with ministers including Penny Mordaunt - tipped by some as a potential replacement - rallying round. \n\nBut Liz Truss insisted last night that Mr Sunak must 'junk' plans such as the phased ban on cigarette sales, regarded as 'nanny state' by critics. \n\nThe tensions surfaced at Cabinet yesterday, with Mr Gove understood to have warned over a lurch to the Right. \n\nArguing that the party needed to maintain 'broad appeal' rather than taking positions that 'make us feel good about ourselves', he quoted supermodel Moss saying: 'Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels.'\n\n+\n7\nView gallery\n\nArguing that the party needed to maintain 'broad appeal' rather than taking positions that 'make us feel good about ourselves', Mr Gove quoted supermodel Moss saying: 'Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels.'\n\n+\n7\nView gallery\n\nOne Tory MP told MailOnline that Mr Gove quoting the supermodel - who did not invent the quip and has since suggested she regrets it - was 'deeply weird'.\n\nEngland Local\nEngland Mayoral\nLondon Assembly\nLondon Mayoral\nPolice & Crime\n\nAccording to the Times, the comments drew a sharp rebuke from Chris Heaton-Harris and Alister Jack, who shot back: 'I disagree with you. We shouldn't be apologists for what we believe in.' \n\nOne Tory MP told MailOnline that Mr Gove quoting the supermodel - who did not invent the quip and has since suggested she regrets it - was 'deeply weird'.    \n\nAnxiety is rising in Conservative circles about the prospect of a wipeout at the election, after the dire showing in council and mayoral polls last week.\n\nFormer immigration minister Robert Jenrick has penned a report demanding a tougher approach on borders, while his ex-boss Suella Braverman has been similarly trenchant about changing direction. \n\nSpeaking at a Tory fundraiser, Ms Mordaunt - often touted as a potential replacement - put on a show of loyalty to Mr Sunak and echoed Mr Gove's message about the need to hold the political centre ground. \n\n'You can't salami-slice Conservatism. If we do that, we lose our the power of our offer,' she said. \n\n'A Labour win at the General Election is not inevitable. It is not. \n\n'A Conservative win at the General Election is not impossible. But right now few can imagine it... \n\n'It is sometimes the people who no one imagines anything of that do the things no one can imagine.' \n\nOn a round of broadcast interviews this morning, Net Zero Secretary Claire Coutinho insisted the Tories were aligned with the priorities of the British public despite the electoral mauling.\n\nShe acknowledged the results were 'disappointing' but said 'I do think we have a positive message that we need to communicate to people'.\n\nAsked if the party needed to shift to the right, the Energy Secretary told Times Radio: 'I think what we need to do is to go where the country is.'\n\nShe added: 'They want us to be tough on immigration. They want us to be cognisant of the fact that they've had a difficult time when it comes to public finances, which is why we're putting forward £900 of tax cuts.\n\n'They want us to make sure that we're protecting their security, which we are when it comes to defence, when it comes to energy as well.\n\n'I would just have contrast with some of Labour's positions, when it comes to their mad energy plans which will hike up people's bills and heap costs on people, with the 75 new business regulations which will deter investment at a time when we need investment coming into this country and

Secondo dati ...","article_body":"Esplora:\nrussia vladimir putin ucraina\nCondividi:\n \n \n \n\nMirko Molteni 08 maggio 2024\na a a\n\nLe esercitazioni russe con armi nucleari tattiche riportano l'attenzione sul vasto arsenale atomico di Mosca, il maggiore del mondo. Secondo dati aggiornati al 2024 dal Bulletin of American Scientists, la Russia disporrebbe di un totale di 5580 testate nucleari, di cui 4380 operative. Posto che le 1200 testate ritirate dal servizio potrebbero essere riattivate come riserva, sui numeri non c'è certezza, dato il rafforzamento varato dal ministro della Difesa Sergei Shoigu. Per confronto, gli Usa schierano 3700 testate operative, ma ne hanno altre 1900 disattivate.\n\nORDIGNI “DA BATTAGLIA”\nIl vantaggio russo è importante nel settore delle testate tattiche, ovvero quelle atomiche di potenza relativamente limitata il cui uso è possibile sul campo di battaglia per colpire divisioni corazzate o di fanteria, oppure avamposti e retrovie logistiche. Il loro raggio di distruzione può misurare da poche centinaia di metri a 2-3 km. Viceversa, le armi strategiche, spesso con portata intercontinentale, spazzano via tutto in un raggio da 5 a 30 km e sono concepite per colpire il territorio nazionale avversario distruggendo città, popolazione o infrastrutture.\n\n \n\nVideo su questo argomento\n\n\"Proteggere i diritti e le libertà dell'uomo\": Vladimir Putin, un paradossale giuramento\n\nLe forze nucleari strategiche russe sono state per molto tempo grossomodo pari a quelle americane perché regolate dal trattato New START, in vigore fra USA e Russia dal 2011 e rinnovato nel 2021 fino alla prevista scadenza del 2026. Pone a ognuna delle due potenze un limite di 700 vettori dispiegati, fra missili e bombardieri, e 1550 testate. Il presidente russo Vladimir Putin ha sospeso da febbraio 2023 l’applicazione del trattato, senza però uscirne. Il divario nelle testate strategiche fra le due potenze era limitato, con 1549 russe e 1421 americane. Al marzo 2024, tuttavia, il Bulletin of American Scientists ha stimato che i russi potrebbero arrivare a 2822 testate strategiche, comprendendo missili lanciati da terra, da sottomarini e da bombardieri. Stima dovuta al fatto che i missili balistici, sia russi sia americani, possono imbarcare più di una testata, secondo il sistema MIRV (veicoli di rientro nell'atmosfera multipli a bersaglio indipendente).\n\nPoiché non consentono più ispezioni americane alle loro basi, causa il conflitto in Ucraina, i russi potrebbero aver aumentato la produzione di testate. Un tipico missile strategico russo, l'RS-24 Yars, ha una gittata di 12.000 km e può portare da 3 a 6 testate di potenza medio-alta, fra 300 e 500 kilotoni l'una, laddove un kilotone equivale alla forza esplosiva di 1000 tonnellate di tritolo.\n\nLa testata ipersonica Avangard, che può essere portata in numero di tre dal missile RS-28 Sarmat, avrebbe una potenza fino a 2 megatoni, ovvero 2000 kilotoni. La bomba di Hiroshima sviluppò solo 12 kilotoni, per cui le bombe strategiche sono molte volte più devastanti. Le armi strategiche fungono da deterrente per scoraggiare uno scontro diretto a lungo raggio Russia-America. Quelle tattiche hanno invece lo scopo di alzare a livelli inaccettabili il prezzo di uno scontro Nato-Russia sul continente europeo.\n\n \n\nBomba atomica sulle Europee: armi nucleari, le indiscrezioni sul piano di Vladimir Putin\n\nDOTTRINE A CONFRONTO\nLe circa 3000 testate tattiche russe, con potenze fra 5 e 100 kilotoni, possono essere portate da vari vettori. Alcune sono sganciabili da aerei come i Sukhoi Su-25 che la Russia ha schierato anche in Bielorussia, sui confini con l'alleanza. Altre possono essere contenute in granate d'artiglieria o equipaggiare missili da 400 km di gittata come gli Iskander, spesso usati in Ucraina con testata convenzionale. Di armi nucleari tattiche la Nato dispone in quantità molto inferiore. Ci sono circa 200 bombe americane aviolanciate B61 in Europa, di cui fra 40 e 70 nelle basi italiane di Ghedi e Aviano. Anche sommando gli arsenali di Francia e Gran Bretagna, circa 550 totali, di cui però molte strategiche, la Nato schiera assai meno nukes tattiche. L'accento posto dai russi sulle testate tattiche riflette la loro dottrina militare che tende ad abbassare la soglia di passaggio dai combattimenti convenzionali a quelli con armi atomiche.

Travaglio sull'ipocrisia della politica e in particolare di Fratelli d'Italia in fatto di garantismo - Guarda il video","article_body":"“Arresto di Giovanni Toti? È un terremoto giudiziario il fatto in sé, cioè il fatto che ci sia il presidente della Regione Liguria ai domiciliari, è un caso piuttosto raro persino per i bassi standard etici della politica italiana“. Sono le parole pronunciate a Otto e mezzo (La7) dal direttore del Fatto Quotidiano, Marco Travaglio, rispondendo a una domanda della conduttrice Lilli Gruber sugli arresti domiciliari di Giovanni Toti, accusato di corruzione.\n\nGruber chiede al direttore del Fatto le ragioni per cui gli uomini di potere sono talvolta poco accorti dimostrando scarsa cautela. E Travaglio risponde: ” Le scarse precauzioni che sembra aver preso Toti dipendono anche dal fatto che ha vissuto per 30 anni all’ombra di Berlusconi. Leggo con stupore che oggi c’è qualcuno che lo rimpiange dicendo che questi sono peggio: non esiste niente di peggiore del berlusconismo. E Toti è uno degli ultimi cascami del berlusconismo, quindi, avendo visto Berlusconi che è riuscito a restare a piede libero nonostante tutto quello che ha combinato nella sua vita, è evidente che ha perso un po’ di freni inibitori”.\n\nVEDI ANCHE\nToti arrestato, Renzi e Sangiuliano: “Siamo garantisti”. Il viceministro Sisto: “Mi auguro non sia giustizia ad orologeria”\n\nIl giornalista, infine, lancia una frecciata al direttore editoriale del Secolo d’Italia Italo Bocchino, che ripete il mantra di tutto il centrodestra e dei renziani sul caso Toti: “C’è una grande ipocrisia perché adesso tutti dicono, come è giusto, di aspettare il processo e il terzo grado di giudizio, ma poi arriva la sentenza definitiva e cosa fanno? Candidano i condannati definitivi. Fratelli d’Italia – spiega – per le europee candida Sgarbi che è un pregiudicato per truffa continuata e aggravata ai danni dello Stato e per falso in atto pubblico. Candida anche Carlo Fidanza, che si è fatto addirittura la sentenza di corruzione da solo, perché ha patteggiato un anno e 4 mesi per corruzione. Quindi, l’ha detto lui stesso che è un corrotto, non qualche giudice cattivo”.\n\nE conclude: “Allora, perché continuano a dire di voler aspettare le sentenze, se poi arriva la sentenza definitiva di condanna e i condannati li mettono in lista?

l'intero stabilimento dell'Alpitronic, leader mondiale delle colonne di ricarica per auto elettriche, in via di Mezzo ai Piani.\n\nIl rogo è scoppiato in una zona nella quale sono in corso lavori di ristrutturazione e si è velocemente allargato. Non risultano feriti o vittime. E' stato chiuso lo spazio aereo sulla città. L'incendio ormai è sotto controllo. La colonna di fumo ora è di dimensioni molto ridotte. Per monitorare i lavori di spegnimento e per localizzare eventuali nuovi focolai i pompieri hanno utilizzato un drone che ha anche immortalato la vastità dell'incendio.\n\nI vigili del fuoco hanno posato tubi verso l'Isarco per pompare l'acqua per spegnere il rogo. I pompieri stanno combattendo il rogo da tutti i lati con autoscale, per garantire un sufficiente approvvigionamento di acqua ora si attinge l'acqua anche dal fiume.\n\n\"L'unica precauzione da adottare è di tenere le finestre chiuse nelle vicinanze. Sul posto ci sono i Vigili del Fuoco ed i tecnici dell'Agenzia dell'Ambiente\". E' quanto comunica il Comune di Bolzano all'ANSA. La Protezione civile altoatesina comunica che \"a Bolzano a causa di un incendio sono presenti fumi intensi.
